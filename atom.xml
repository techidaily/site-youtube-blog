Like 35mm film cameras of the past, DSLR cameras are built with an angled mirror inside its camera body. This mirror allows you to look into your camera’s optical viewfinder and see exactly what your camera sees.</p><p>The mirror inside a DSLR camera flips up out of the way when you open the shutter to allow light to reach the camera’s image sensor.</p><p>Check out our list of the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >7 Best DSLR Cameras For Vlogging <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h2 id="What-is-a-Mirrorless-Camera"><a href="#What-is-a-Mirrorless-Camera" class="headerlink" title="What is a Mirrorless Camera?"></a>What is a Mirrorless Camera?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mirrorless-camera.jpg"                      alt="Mirrorless Camera"                ></p><p>Mirrorless cameras are interchangeable lens cameras without a mirror inside the camera body. With nothing to reflect your image, you won’t find any optical viewfinder to look through to see exactly what your camera sees.</p><p>Light passes through the lens of a mirrorless camera and lands directly onto the camera’s sensor.</p><p>Check out our list of the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >8 Best Mirrorless Cameras For Vlogging <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h2 id="Mirrorless-vs-DSLR-a-Complete-Comparison"><a href="#Mirrorless-vs-DSLR-a-Complete-Comparison" class="headerlink" title="Mirrorless vs. DSLR - a Complete Comparison"></a>Mirrorless vs. DSLR - a Complete Comparison</h2><h4 id="Size-and-Weight"><a href="#Size-and-Weight" class="headerlink" title="Size and Weight"></a>Size and Weight</h4><p>DSLR cameras are larger and heavier than mirrorless cameras because there are more parts that go into their camera bodies. DSLR cameras require enough space inside for an angled mirror to flip up out of the way.</p><p>If your video shooting style is more on-the-go, like that of a daily vlogger or travel vlogger, the smaller size and lighter weight of a mirrorless camera may be more suitable for you.</p><h4 id="Previewing-Images"><a href="#Previewing-Images" class="headerlink" title="Previewing Images"></a>Previewing Images</h4><p>When you’re using a DSLR camera, your optical viewfinder will show you exactly what your camera sees as opposed to a digital preview of what your image sensor picks up. No matter how bright or dark your scene actually is, through the optical viewfinder, you’ll be able to clearly see what your camera sees with the power of your eye.</p><p>Mirrorless cameras, on the other hand, display on your camera’s screen or electronic viewfinder a digital preview of what your camera is looking at. You will notice a lag, especially in low light, between actions that are taking place in front of the camera and the same actions being displayed in your live preview.</p><h4 id="Lenses-and-Accessories"><a href="#Lenses-and-Accessories" class="headerlink" title="Lenses and Accessories"></a>Lenses and Accessories</h4><p>Having been around much longer, there are plenty more options for lenses and accessories when it comes to shooting with DSLR cameras. You can choose from all kinds of different quality levels and price ranges.</p><h4 id="Video-Resolution"><a href="#Video-Resolution" class="headerlink" title="Video Resolution"></a>Video Resolution</h4><p>4K video recording is more readily available in mirrorless cameras than DSLR cameras. At a much more affordable budget, you can get your hands on a 4K mirrorless camera. If you want to shoot 4K video on a DSLR camera, though, you will have to pay for some of the most expensive DSLR cameras on the market.</p><h4 id="Image-Stabilization"><a href="#Image-Stabilization" class="headerlink" title="Image Stabilization"></a>Image Stabilization</h4><p>Up until quite recently, you needed to get the right lens with built-in optical image stabilization if you wanted to shoot stabilized photos and videos with an interchangeable lens camera. Image stabilization had not been readily available in the bodies of these cameras.</p><p>In recent years, however, mirrorless cameras have been much more active in their development of camera bodies equipped with shifting image sensors. Your shots can be even more stabilized when the optical image stabilization of your lens is combined with your camera’s in-body sensor-shift image stabilization.</p><h4 id="Battery-Life"><a href="#Battery-Life" class="headerlink" title="Battery Life"></a>Battery Life</h4><p>When it comes to shooting video, DSLR cameras and mirrorless cameras consume about the same amount of power. It’s still safe to say, though, that DSLR cameras, for the most part, have better battery life than mirrorless cameras because their bigger batteries are packed with more power.</p><h2 id="Mirrorless-vs-DSLR-Which-One-is-Better-for-Video"><a href="#Mirrorless-vs-DSLR-Which-One-is-Better-for-Video" class="headerlink" title="Mirrorless vs. DSLR - Which One is Better for Video?"></a>Mirrorless vs. DSLR - Which One is Better for Video?</h2><p>In my opinion, when it comes to filming a video, mirrorless cameras are the way to go. In such a short time, mirrorless cameras have made huge leaps in their capabilities. It won’t be long before the ultimate vlogging camera comes out on the mirrorless market.</p><p>In the end, if you need to edit videos futhermore, try Filmora <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

Making video viewers enjoy enough that they click on your channel page - that’s hard. Channel art is just about reinforcing the positive feelings viewers have come away from your videos. Anyone who’s looking at your channel art is already thinking about subscribing to you. Your banner should make viewers feel happy with the choice they’ve already half-made.</p><ol><li><a href="#basics">YouTube Banner Size and Other Basics</a></li><li><a href="#resources">Free YouTube Banner Templates and Other Resources</a></li><li><a href="#makers">Free Channel Art Makers</a></li><li><a href="#tips">How to Make Good Channel Art</a></li><li><a href="#inspiration">Channel Art Inspiration</a></li></ol><h2 id="YouTube-Banner-Size-and-Other-Basics"><a href="#YouTube-Banner-Size-and-Other-Basics" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Banner Size and Other Basics"></a><strong>YouTube Banner Size and Other Basics</strong></h2><p>YouTube channel art should be 2560 x 1440px.</p><p>As long as you upload an image or background that is that size, viewers looking at your channel on any device will be able to see that you’ve taken the time to personalize your channel page.</p><p>If you want to make a bit more of an impression, you can start thinking about banner dimensions. Depending on what type of screen (laptop, mobile, television) a viewer is visiting your channel on, they will see a different crop of that 2560 x 1440px channel art. That cropped image is your banner.</p><p>Television will display the entire image, but it is significantly smaller on other devices.</p><p>Desktop or laptop computers can show a view as large as 2560 x 423px, or as small as 1546 x 423px.</p><p>Tablets show an area that’s 1855 x 423px.</p><p>Mobile phones show an area that’s 1546 x 423px. This size is also the smallest possible desktop&#x2F;laptop view, and it is considered the ‘safe area.’ Any important text or graphics in your banner should fit within this section, or they could be awkwardly cut off in some views.</p><p>Here’s a visual guide to channel art dimensions:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/channel-art-cheat-sheet.jpg"                      alt="channel-art-cheat-sheet"                ></p><p>Another important detail to consider is the size of your file. YouTube will allow your channel art to have a file size of up to 6MB, but no larger.</p><h2 id="Free-YouTube-Banner-Templates-and-Other-Resources"><a href="#Free-YouTube-Banner-Templates-and-Other-Resources" class="headerlink" title="Free YouTube Banner Templates and Other Resources"></a><strong>Free YouTube Banner Templates and Other Resources</strong></h2><p>There are a lot of free resources online, which can make the process of designing your channel art simple, including <a href="#templates">templates</a>, <a href="#photos">stock images</a>, <a href="#patterns">backgrounds</a>, and <a href="#fonts">fonts</a>.</p><h4 id="Free-YouTube-Banner-Templates"><a href="#Free-YouTube-Banner-Templates" class="headerlink" title="Free YouTube Banner Templates"></a><strong>Free YouTube Banner Templates</strong></h4><p>The easiest way to get great channel art might be to find something pre-built you can personalize. There are a few places online you can find something free that will suit both your style and the types of videos you make:</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><strong>filmora.wondershare.com</strong></a></p><p>Here on filmora.io, we have a selection of <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >50 free channel art templates <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you can download. The banners are divided into 10 categories representing both different types of YouTube channels (i.e., gaming and beauty) and different popular styles (i.e., minimalist and galaxy), so there’s something for everybody. When you download the free templates, you can choose between PSD files, so you can customize your banner in Photoshop and PNG files you can use with a free online program like Canva (or even Paint on your computer).</p><p><a href="http://blog.visme.co/youtube-banner-template/"><strong>Visme</strong></a></p><p>On Visme, you’ll find another 50 free YouTube banners with themes like ‘Rock Star,’ ‘Makeup Tutorial,’ and ‘Cooking Lessons.’ The banners all make use of beautiful high-quality photographs (no patterned backgrounds). You can add your own channel name right on Visme and customize your font&#x2F;color.</p><p><a href="http://yourtubetheme.com/channel-art/"><strong>YourTube</strong></a></p><p>There is a massive amount of resources available on YourTube, which you can download for free. The category labeled templates only has 14 options, but there are really hundreds of options for YouTube channel art. ‘Templates’ just means downloads, which include PSD files where you can edit text. Under ‘All YouTube Channel Art,’ there are over 500 options. Some are patterned backgrounds, some are pictures, but all of them were designed to be channel art. It’s easy to look and imagine where your channel’s name will go.</p><p>There are also a lot of <a href="#makers">Channel Art Makers</a>, which include templates!</p><h4 id="Free-Stock-Images-Backgrounds-and-Fonts"><a href="#Free-Stock-Images-Backgrounds-and-Fonts" class="headerlink" title="Free Stock Images, Backgrounds, and Fonts"></a><strong>Free Stock Images, Backgrounds, and Fonts</strong></h4><p>Sometimes all you need to do is add some text to a really great photo or background pattern. You can find awesome-looking and free options for all three of these things and piece together your own unique channel art.</p><p><strong>Free Stock Photos for YouTube Channel Art</strong></p><p>Unlike templates, stock photos will not already be the exact right size for uploading to YouTube. You’ll have to adjust them, but you don’t need expensive software to do this. You can use a banner maker, or just do some trimming in Paint. While you are making adjustments, <a href="#basics">keep the dimensions</a> from the first part of this article in mind, so important details aren’t partially cut off on some devices.</p><p>There are a lot of beautiful photographs available online, and sites like Stocksy are great if you have the budget available to purchase images. If you need free options, then there are lots of those too, but you do sometimes need to be careful that the way you want to use an image is allowed within the license provided by the site or photographer.</p><p>We recommend these two sites for anybody who finds copyright rules confusing because both of these sites allow you to use their photos for free, for any purpose (commercial or personal), without attribution (although they do appreciate attribution).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/free-youtube-banner-unsplash.jpg"                      alt="free-youtube-banner-unsplash"                ></p><p><a href="https://unsplash.com/"><strong>Unsplash:</strong></a> This site has a huge selection, and more photos are being added all the time. Finding what you want is as easy as typing a keyword (i.e., ‘sunset’) into the search bar on the home page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/free-youtube-banner-pexels.jpg"                      alt="free-youtube-banner-pexels"                ></p><p><a href="https://www.pexels.com/"><strong>Pexels:</strong></a> you can find a wide variety of images on Pexels just by using the search bar on the main page, much like Unsplash. There is actually some overlap in the images available on the two sites, but they also each have photos the other doesn’t, so it’s worth looking at both.</p><h4 id="Free-Background-Patterns-for-YouTube-Banners"><a href="#Free-Background-Patterns-for-YouTube-Banners" class="headerlink" title="Free Background Patterns for YouTube Banners"></a><strong>Free Background Patterns for YouTube Banners</strong></h4><p>Photographs just don’t suit every type of channel. If you don’t think photos of scenery match the style of your channel, you might want to consider a background pattern. Because patterns repeat, you don’t need to worry much about things being cut off when you upload a pattern as channel art (although you’ll still need to make sure any text you add is in the <a href="#basics">safe area</a>).</p><p>One thing you should watch for when using a background pattern is that text can sometimes be hard to read if it’s sitting on top of a busy pattern. You might want to put a box of solid color between your channel name and the pattern.</p><p>The patterns on the following two sites are free to use.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/free-youtube-banner-the-pattern-library.png"                      alt="free-youtube-banner-the-pattern-library"                ></p><p><a href="http://thepatternlibrary.com/"><strong>The Pattern Library:</strong></a> this truly is a library, and all the patterns were submitted by real graphic designers. When you first arrive on the site, all you’ll see is a randomly selected pattern filling your entire screen. Hovering over the designer’s name in the top left will allow you to download it for free.</p><p>Often, the download will not be as large as the image you see on the site. It will only be a few tiles (or just one tile), and you will need to copy&#x2F;paste it a few times to create a background large enough to use as channel art.</p><p>You can use the navigation tools in the top right of the screen to see more patterns. Clicking the icon that looks like a bunch of squares will allow you to see multiple patterns at once.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/free-youtube-banner-hero-pattern.jpg"                      alt="free-youtube-banner-hero-pattern"                ></p><p><a href="https://www.heropatterns.com/"><strong>Hero Patterns:</strong></a> the patterns on this site are editable before you download. You choose a foreground color, a background color, and the opacity of the design in the foreground. This means that you can make the pattern as subtle or vibrant as you want, which is a great thing to have control over when you’re creating channel art.</p><p>When you choose your custom colors and opacity, every pattern preview on the page will update. You can put in the colors you like for your channel first, and then find a pattern that looks good with them.</p><p>The only downside to Hero Patterns is that downloading your pattern is hard. You actually can’t just download it. Instead, the site generates a code you can embed on a website.</p><p>If you don’t have a website, the easiest thing is probably to use the Snipping Tool (included on all PCs since Vista) to save the preview and then just copy&#x2F;paste it as a tile in a program like Paint or Photoshop.</p><h4 id="Free-Fonts-for-YouTube-Channel-Art"><a href="#Free-Fonts-for-YouTube-Channel-Art" class="headerlink" title="Free Fonts for YouTube Channel Art"></a><strong>Free Fonts for YouTube Channel Art</strong></h4><p>Whatever program you use to build your channel art will already have a selection of fonts. Finding the perfect font to use across your channel art, thumbnails, and for any text, you include in your videos isn’t something you need to think about until your channel is large enough that you’re thinking about your ‘brand’. If you feel like you’re at that stage, or want to get a jump start on it, here are a couple of sites where you can find free fonts and install them on your computer.</p><p><a href="https://www.dafont.com/"><strong>DaFont:</strong></a> there are categories on this site like fancy, gothic, and script, and there are even sub-categories like sci-fi and calligraphy. Licensing limits (whether the font is free and whether it is available for commercial use) will be clearly displayed next to every font. When browsing, you can even type your channel name in where it says ‘Preview’ and see what it will look like in all the different fonts.</p><p><a href="https://www.fontsquirrel.com/"><strong>Font Squirrel:</strong></a> the nice thing about this site is that everything is guaranteed to be free and available for commercial use. If you scroll down a bit on the main page, you’ll see a toolbar to the right of the screen, which will allow you to narrow down the fonts being displayed by selecting tags like grunge, headings, and casual.</p><p>Once you’ve got an image or images, and maybe even a font you want to use in your banner, you can create your channel art in either a software like Photoshop or a free banner maker (anchor) like the ones below.</p><h2 id="Free-Channel-Art-Makers"><a href="#Free-Channel-Art-Makers" class="headerlink" title="Free Channel Art Makers"></a><strong>Free Channel Art Makers</strong></h2><p>You don’t need an expensive program like Adobe Photoshop to make great channel art. There is a lot of photo editing and graphic design programs available for free online, and most of them are a lot easier to use.</p><p>All three of these sites will allow you to build your banner just by dragging images and text to where you want them, and they even provide premade templates (although those might not be free in some cases).</p><p><a href="https://www.canva.com/"><strong>Canva</strong></a></p><p>Canva is probably the most popular site for creating YouTube banners for free, for a good reason. It’s extremely intuitive for beginners who are making their first graphics, and it’s also a capable enough program to satisfy more intermediate-level users. Canva has stock images, banner templates, and other graphics available, but some of them cost $1 to use. You can also upload your own media instead of relying on Canva’s resources.</p><p>To build channel art in Canva, find ‘YouTube Channel Art’ as one of the options, and you’ll be working with a canvas that’s already the right size. You can also choose from a lot of different layout options, which will divide your canvas into different drop zones for images (pictures will be auto-sized to fit the zone).</p><p>One major <strong>benefit</strong> of Canva is the huge library of stock images, and one <strong>drawback</strong> is that you can’t have multiple images stretched to the end of your canvas.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/fotophire/download/"><strong>Wondershare PixStudio:</strong></a></p><p>Wondershare PixStudio is an all-in-one and powerful online graphic design maker for everyone. This online platform empowers anyone to create a beautiful design within a few steps. No professional skills required! By simply dragging and dropping the creative elements and templates, you are capable to release your imagination and convert it to stunning artwork.</p><p>A major <strong>benefit</strong> of PixStudio is that it provides a feature to remove the image background, you can use the image more flexibility. One <strong>drawback</strong> is that the features will be used after payment of $7.99 per month.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ultimate-guide-to-effective-youtube-banners.jpg"                      alt="Wondershare PixStudio Banner Maker"                ></p><p><a href="https://www.designwizard.com/"><strong>Design Wizard</strong></a></p><p>This is another easy to use image editor with templates and stock images, like Canva. You just select YouTube Cover from the options in the Social Media menu (there are also options for YouTube Thumbnails and Profile Pics).</p><p>In Canva, images you drag into your layout will automatically shift to fit the area you put them into. This doesn’t happen in Design Wizard, which can either slow down or speed up your process, depending on which you prefer.</p><p>One major <strong>benefit</strong> of Design Wizard is that it provides you with a ‘safe zone box’ so you can see the smallest view of your channel art while you work. One <strong>drawback</strong> is that the photos in Design Wizard aren’t free, so you’ll either have to buy them or use your own.</p><p><strong>Tip:</strong> the safe zone box costs $1, so the price of your download will always look like $1 until you delete it when you’re finished designing. Then your price will drop to $0 if you haven’t used any other paid elements.</p><p><a href="https://www.fotor.com/"><strong>Fotor</strong></a></p><p>Fotor works similarly to the other two programs on this list. Just look for ‘YouTube Channel Art’ in the Header &amp; Cover section and click on it to start designing. It does not have layouts like Canva, but it is also a drag-and-drop program, and it is better than Canva if you like to edit with layers.</p><p>Fotor has more free templates than Canva or Design Wizard, although it does also have some premium options. Creating a paid account will allow you to access premium resources and get rid of ads (costs $39.99 for the year), but if all you want it for is to create channel art, a paid account probably isn’t worth it.</p><p>You can upload your own images to use in Fotor as well.</p><p>A major <strong>benefit</strong> of Fotor is that it has a lot of genuinely free channel art templates you can customize, and one <strong>drawback</strong> is that it doesn’t have as many stock photos.</p><h2 id="How-to-Make-Good-Channel-Art"><a href="#How-to-Make-Good-Channel-Art" class="headerlink" title="How to Make Good Channel Art"></a><strong>How to Make Good Channel Art</strong></h2><p>Finding an image, cutting it to the right size, and uploading it to YouTube is easy, but how many of your favorite YouTubers use just an image for their channel art? Usually, there’s at least a little text stating the name of the channel.</p><p>In this section, we’ll give you a quick checklist of things to include in your banner (anchor), and some tips on making excellent channel art.</p><h4 id="Channel-Art-Checklist"><a href="#Channel-Art-Checklist" class="headerlink" title="Channel Art Checklist"></a><strong>Channel Art Checklist</strong></h4><p>Here are some things you might want to include in your YouTube banner. Not all of these are right for every type of channel.</p><ol><li>Channel name</li><li>What kinds of videos you make</li><li>Your posting schedule</li><li>Social media handles</li><li>Your face</li><li>A tagline <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-channel-art-layout.jpg"                      alt="YouTube channel art layout"                ></li></ol><h4 id="Top-5-Tips-for-Making-Great-YouTube-Banners"><a href="#Top-5-Tips-for-Making-Great-YouTube-Banners" class="headerlink" title="Top 5 Tips for Making Great YouTube Banners"></a><strong>Top 5 Tips for Making Great YouTube Banners</strong></h4><p>Besides looking good, your channel art can help convince more of your viewers to become subscribers. Here are our top 5 tips for making channel art that looks impressive and supports the growth of your channel.</p><ol><li><a href="#solidbackground">Solid Background Behind Text</a></li><li><a href="#minimaltext">Keep Text to a Minimum</a></li><li><a href="#imagesandcolors">Use Images and Colors That Suit Your Channel</a></li><li><a href="#face">Include Your Face</a></li><li><a href="#reason">Give Viewers a Reason To Subscribe</a></li></ol><p><strong>Solid Background Behind Text</strong></p><p>When viewers look at your channel page, you want your name and any other information your banner conveys to jump out at them. It is hard for text to jump out at anybody when it’s competing with a busy background, especially if some of the colors in the background are similar to the color of the text.</p><p>If possible, you can place your text on the part of your background pattern or image where there isn’t much happening behind it. When that isn’t possible, it doesn’t mean you need to find a new background. Instead, insert a solid-colored shape between the text and your background image. Your text will look great, and you won’t have to compromise on a background you like.</p><p><strong>Keep Text to a Minimum</strong></p><p>There is a lot you might want to say in your banner. You’ll want to tell viewers the name of the channel, what kinds of videos you make, when you upload those different kinds of videos, and maybe even the general philosophy driving your channel (i.e., ‘to spread positivity’). That’s all great, but try to say it fast.</p><p>Realistically, viewers probably won’t read more than one line of text. Writing more than that could also force you to use smaller text that viewers will have trouble reading. Ideally, a viewer should absorb all the information in your banner at a glance without having to make the decision to read it.</p><p>Keep your text to your channel name and one additional line underneath, if you can. Make sure your additional line of text is smaller than your channel name, so they aren’t competing.</p><p><strong>Use Images and Colors that Suit Your Channel</strong></p><p>If you have an upbeat, positive, channel then a black and red banner with skulls on it might not be the best choice to convey that. Similarly, if you have a gaming channel, then a minimalist banner that includes an Instagram-worthy picture of you wearing the latest seasonal styles might send the wrong message. It will make the viewer that sees it think you have a lifestyle channel, and they may click away thinking the Let’s Play they just watched was a one-off.</p><p>Look at the kinds of colors and images other YouTubers in your niche are using for inspiration for what you should do, but also consider the unique message of your channel. If you consider yourself bold, use bolder colors. If your videos have a more relaxed vibe, something softer might make sense.</p><p>Here’s a guide to what people tend to associate with different colors:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/color-implication.jpg"                      alt="color-implication"                ></p><p><strong>Include Your Face</strong></p><p>This isn’t essential for every type of channel. If you mostly post gaming content or screencast tutorials and you don’t appear much in your actual videos, there’s no need to appear in your banner.</p><p>However, if your channel is primarily about you as a personality, then including your face in your channel art can have a lot of benefits. People are automatically drawn in by eye contact and feel more connected when they can see a face. Besides just looking good, including your face in your banner can help build a relationship with new viewers and make them feel more comfortable subscribing. They’ll know they’re subscribing to a person, not just a channel.</p><p><strong>Give Viewers a Reason to Subscribe</strong></p><p>Someone who has chosen to check out your channel page is already thinking about subscribing, but they didn’t do it from the video page because they want to know a bit more about you. The things they are probably hoping to find out are:</p><ol><li>Do you have more videos like that one they just watched? Will you make more?</li><li>Are you ever going to post again?</li></ol><p>There are a lot of YouTubers that just give up at some point, or who have started a channel but don’t have time to post very often. That you might never post a new video again, or might not post one for so long that the new subscriber forgets who you are, is a real hesitation viewer can have about subscribing.</p><p>Viewers also want to know that when you do post again, the video you post will be something they like. If they liked the video, they found you through because it was funny, but there’s nothing on your channel page that suggests you do comedy videos regularly, then that can make someone think twice. If you subscribe because of a makeup tutorial, but then the creator only posts personal vlogs from then on, it can be disappointing.</p><p>By clearly stating what kinds of videos you make and when you post them in your banner, you are giving viewers a reason to subscribe.</p><p>Here are some examples:</p><p><em>“Vlogs &amp; Comedy! New videos every Tuesday.”</em></p><p><em>“Two videos every week! Makeup Mondays and Fashion Fridays”</em></p><p>If you can create channel art that has a layout that makes sense and sends a clear message even at a glance, then that will help you look like a more experienced YouTuber.</p><h2 id="Channel-Art-Inspiration"><a href="#Channel-Art-Inspiration" class="headerlink" title="Channel Art Inspiration"></a><strong>Channel Art Inspiration</strong></h2><p>Sometimes your niche on YouTube will determine what kinds of channel art you should use. For example, it makes sense for gamers to include game-related graphics in their banners and for travel vloggers to use photos from the destinations they’ve visited.</p><p>However, for lots of YouTube niches, the channel art you make will be built around your personality. How do you know what fits your personality? Here’s some inspiration based on popular trends.</p><p><strong>Minimalism</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/text-and-logo-minimalism.jpg"                      alt="text-and-logo-minimalism"                ></p><p>This is an example of a minimalist YouTube banner. This style typically uses only 2 or 3 colors and features clean lines, simple backgrounds, and not a lot of noise. If you want to project a calm, tidy, balanced vibe on your channel, then you should consider going in a minimalist direction with your banner.</p><p>This example is light and airy, but you can also create a minimalist look using brighter or darker colors. It just depends on your personality.</p><p><strong>Galaxy Themed</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/text-and-logo-galaxy-themed.jpg"                      alt="text-and-logo-galaxy-themed"                ></p><p>Galaxy banners are exactly what they sound like: channel art featuring space scenes or photographs of the night sky. At first glance, you might think they belong with channels that talk about science or sci-fi, and they are great for that, but they’re also a fun choice for comedy, vlogging, or gaming.</p><p>The great thing about the galaxy style is that it’s cool and different, but it doesn’t take over and distract from your message. There is a lot of room for a space scene to be very personalized. The example above is bold and purple. You can find galaxy photos in just about any color, and they can be either bright like this one or quite dark.</p><p><strong>Funky</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/text-and-logo-Funky.jpg"                      alt="text-and-logo-Funky"                ></p><p>There isn’t really one ‘funky’ style. A funky banner is anything that’s just a little off-beat but still makes sense while you’re looking at it. They tend to be bright and cheerful and are perfect for anyone who considers themselves a bit quirky.</p><p>If you’re looking for inspiration for a custom funky banner, go to your closet and find your favorite funny, cute, or ironic t-shirt. There’s probably something in its design you can bring into your channel art.</p><p><strong>Comic</strong></p><p><img src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/text-and-logo-comic.jpg" alt="/text-and-logo-comic"></p><p>A banner featuring an actual comic book character probably belongs to a channel that discusses comics, but the style itself is great for just about anyone. It’s bold and communicates confidence. If your attitude towards YouTube is that you want to be fearless, why not go for something worthy of a superhuman?</p><p>Do you have any of your own tips to share about YouTube banners?</p><p>If you want to find a video editing solution that empowers your imagination and creativity yet takes less effort, please try this robust and user-friendly video editing software <strong>Wondershare Filmora</strong>.

However, for almost all YouTubers, their mind will soon turn to whether they can <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >make money from YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and how much they could be making.</p><p>If you’re curious about how much money you could make from your channel, or just want to see what the potential is for creating a revenue stream once you’ve built your audience, we’ve got just the thing for you. We’ve developed this YouTube Money Calculator, a simple tool that lets you see at a glance how much you could be earning from your videos and channel.

For the creator, this is the amount of money they make per thousand ad impressions).</p><p>YouTube calculators will never be able to know the CPM for a YouTube channel as the rates vary for different channels and different ads. Disclosing your CPM is against the rules, so there’s not a lot of information out there to go on.</p><p>However, by taking an average of some of the current CPM rates from advertisers on YouTube, calculators are able to average out what a YouTube channel could be making. Keep in mind that, usually, the numbers that they use can be a bit on the high side compared to actual earnings. At times, though, these calculators can be very close.</p><h2 id="Part-2-The-Free-YouTube-Money-Calculator"><a href="#Part-2-The-Free-YouTube-Money-Calculator" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: The Free YouTube Money Calculator"></a>Part 2: The Free YouTube Money Calculator</h2><p>The YouTube Money Calculator is a free calculator tool that allows you to estimate the money obtained from any YouTube video. Calculations are entirely based on the number of views and an average CPM of $2 - $5. A user just needs to insert the total number of video views that they think they can get or that another channel has to discover how much a person could earn or be earning.</p><p>If you don’t know your CPM yet, don’t worry because our tool can give you an estimated revenue calculation based on a commonly accepted range of CPM figures for your views. Using this number, the YouTube Money Calculator can give you potential revenue by video as well as by channel on a daily, monthly, and yearly basis. Let’s take a look:</p><ul><li><a href="#videos">1. Estimated YouTube Revenue by Videos</a></li><li><a href="#channel">2.

Estimated YouTube Revenue by Videos"></a>1. Estimated YouTube Revenue by Videos</h3><p>To use YouTube Money Calculator to get an estimated calculation of your revenue for a single video, simply set the number of views you get per day (or hope to get) and the CPM rates. If you don’t know your CPM, the tool will automatically select a typical range based on the number of views.</p><p>From here you can start to play around and see what the impact could be of a different number of views and different CPM range. Do keep in mind that these figures are estimated, and there are many factors that come into play to determine your final CPM rate.</p><p>If you want to go deeper into your research and discover how much revenue a specific video could make, you can simply paste in the URL of the video you want to investigate, and the YouTube Money Calculator will show you the results. These will be presented as the number of total video views as well as the estimated earnings for that video based on typical CPM rates, making it a great resource to establish whether to monetize a video or not.</p><h3 id="2-Estimated-YouTube-Revenue-by-Channel"><a href="#2-Estimated-YouTube-Revenue-by-Channel" class="headerlink" title="2. Estimated YouTube Revenue by Channel"></a>2. Estimated YouTube Revenue by Channel</h3><p>If you’d like a more complete view of your YouTube earnings potential, why not investigate the revenue possibilities for the whole channel? Simply paste your channel link into the box and our tool will estimate how much you could be earning if you monetize that channel.</p><p>As well as showing this, the tool will show all sorts of other useful information such as number of total views, number of subscribers, number of uploaded videos and even your country and category. It’s a great place to start to evaluate your efforts and to get a realistic idea of what your earnings could be.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Free-YouTube-Money-Calculator-Alternatives"><a href="#Part-3-Free-YouTube-Money-Calculator-Alternatives" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Free YouTube Money Calculator Alternatives"></a>Part 3: Free YouTube Money Calculator Alternatives</h2><p>Some of the best YouTube Money Calculator alternatives available are:</p><ul><li><a href="#social"><strong>Social Blade</strong></a></li><li><a href="#influencer"><strong>Influencer Marketing Hub</strong></a></li></ul><h3 id="1-How-Social-Blade-Calculates-YouTube-Money"><a href="#1-How-Social-Blade-Calculates-YouTube-Money" class="headerlink" title="1.

Users need only type in the name of the channel they are interested in and Social Blade will deliver all kinds of information about that channel, like how many subscribers and views it received in the last 30 days. It will also include estimates of monthly and yearly earnings. The revenue results are adjusted based off of the overall size of the channel and the total number of views that they receive each day. You can even scroll down for estimates of daily earnings listed by date.</p><h3 id="2-How-Influencer-Marketing-Hub-Calculates-YouTube-Money"><a href="#2-How-Influencer-Marketing-Hub-Calculates-YouTube-Money" class="headerlink" title="2.

How Influencer Marketing Hub Calculates YouTube Money</h3><p>Influencer Marketing Hub is almost like an active infographic that allows a user to very quickly adjust sliders based on the daily video views, active engagement, views per month, and views per year.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-is-YouTube-Partner-Money-Calculated"><a href="#Part-4-How-is-YouTube-Partner-Money-Calculated" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How is YouTube Partner Money Calculated?"></a>Part 4: How is YouTube Partner Money Calculated?</h2><p>YouTube partner money is calculated using something called the CPM. Your CPM, if you’re new to YouTube and partner advertising, is likely to be quite low, but can be built up over time.</p><p>CPM is actually a term for advertisers rather than content creators, as it denotes the amount an advertiser pays to serve its ad to 1,000 views of a video. What you really want to know is your RPM, or revenue per thousand, which is about how much you’ll get paid for 1,000 views of that ad. In the YouTube world, they call this number eCPM which stands for effective CPM, and if you have access to YouTube analytics, you’ll be able to find it under the estimated monetized playbacks metric.</p><p>If you don’t have YouTube Analytics, you can estimate your eCPM by dividing your most recent earnings by the number of monetized views and then multiplying by 1,000. For example, if you got 10,000 views of a video and earned $30, then your CPM would be $3.</p><p>There are a number of factors that affect what your CPM is, including what category it’s in, what the season is (e.g. Christmas, Halloween), what language you speak, which country you’re from, how much competition there is and much more. As an average, most advertisers are paying in the region of $7.60 per 1,000 impressions, although this can be as high as $15 or as low as $0.10.</p><p>But that’s not the whole story.</p><p>Of course, YouTube needs to make money too, so don’t expect to see all of that $7.60 popped into your AdSense account. Google keeps 45 percent of all YouTube advertising revenue, so you’ll get the other 55 per cent. If you were earning that average $7.60, your actual earnings would be $4.18 per 1,000 views.</p><p>As your subscriber numbers rise and your daily views rise, so will your CPM, so don’t get disheartened if you’ve discovered you’re on $2 or worse. Keep plugging away and building your fan base, and you’ll get there in the end.</p><p>It’s important to realize that, for most new channels, they’ll need to post videos for around two years before they start earning anything significant. If you’re just getting started on YouTube, find your niche and make sure it’s one that advertisers care about. Get it right, and you’ll have a highly targeted audience base which advertisers are willing to pay good money to use.</p><h2 id="Part-5-How-to-Join-the-YouTube-Partner-Platform"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-Join-the-YouTube-Partner-Platform" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: How to Join the YouTube Partner Platform"></a>Part 5: How to Join the YouTube Partner Platform</h2><p>If you’ve had a go with the YouTube money calculator and are excited about the potential to make money from YouTube, the next thing you’ll need to do is to sign up for the partner program. Here’s how:</p><pre><code>     * **Find out if you qualify**: You&#39;ll need to be 18 or over and to have had at least 4,000 views on your channel and 1,000 subscribers in the past 12 months     * **Enable monetization on your account**: Sign in, select &#39;creator studio&#39;, then go to Channel &gt; Status features. Look for the tab for Monetization and click to enable.     * **Agree to the terms**: Once you&#39;ve read and agreed to them, click accept     * **Choose monetizing options**: Pick from overlay in the video, TrueView in-stream ads or video contains product placement. You can always change this later.     * **Confirm enrolment**: Click &#39;monetize my videos&#39; to confirm enrolment</code></pre><p>Once you’ve done all that, YouTube will review your application and decide if you can join the program. Usually, this happens within a matter of seconds, generating confirmation via email. Your account will now have ‘Partner Verified’ on it, and your chosen ads will start being displayed immediately.</p><h2 id="Part-6-Making-Money-on-YouTube"><a href="#Part-6-Making-Money-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: Making Money on YouTube"></a>Part 6: Making Money on YouTube</h2><p>We’ve all been seduced by the big hitters on YouTube, from PewDiePie to Lilly Singh, and have imagined that we’ll be the next YouTube millionaire.

You might have also watched some videos from influencers telling you that the ruthless YouTube algorithm demands daily content if you aspire to grow an audience.</p><p>There are many reasons why you may want to try your hand at becoming a daily vlogger, but here are 3 motivating reasons to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >conquer your vlogging fears <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and get started.</p><h2 id="Bonus-Tip-The-Best-Daily-Vlog-Maker-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#Bonus-Tip-The-Best-Daily-Vlog-Maker-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Tip-The Best Daily Vlog Maker- Wondershare Filmora"></a>Bonus Tip-The Best Daily Vlog Maker- Wondershare Filmora</h2><p>Vlogging is an art and people use vlogging to upload videos daily to their YouTube channel. This is natural if you are recording videos daily, you will need a tool like Wondershare Filmora to edit your videos with precision. To make your task easy, Wondershare Filmora has all the features and effects that are required to edit a daily vlog video that you can upload directly from Filmora itself. You can make use of features like add text, background music, filters &amp; effects, etc if you are a daily vlogger as it would help you a lot in making the video look professional in less time.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Mac Version"                > </a></p><h2 id="Why-Daily-Vlog-Anyways"><a href="#Why-Daily-Vlog-Anyways" class="headerlink" title="Why Daily Vlog Anyways?"></a><strong>Why Daily Vlog Anyways?</strong></h2><p> <strong>Build discipline</strong>: Like exercising and eating healthy, you have to commit to it and do it regularly in order to see any lasting results. Vlogging is the same. However, if you’re a creator, making videos whenever you feel like it and want to give yourself a kick in the behind, daily vlogging is a practice that will keep you accountable. You have to do it every day. No excuses.</p><p><strong>Practice more</strong>: How do the best become the best? They practice… every day. If what you want to do is become the greatest video creator you can be, make the best videos you can make, and build the largest following that you can, then let daily vlogging be your boot camp to reach those goals.</p><p><strong>Please the YouTube algorithm</strong>: It’s true, YouTube wants to see that you are consistently posting fresh content. Every new video you upload will have a day or two to impress the algorithm, this metric is often referred to as <a class="link"   href="https://youtu.be/Kj7L%5FfXhifw" >view velocity <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. YouTube will give your video a lift, suggesting it to new viewers, if they see that it is being enjoyed. By publishing daily, you increase your chances of attracting more viewers.</p><p>Now that you know the benefits, how should you approach it?</p><h2 id="The-Dos-and-Don’ts-of-Daily-Vlogging-1"><a href="#The-Dos-and-Don’ts-of-Daily-Vlogging-1" class="headerlink" title="The Dos and Don’ts of Daily Vlogging"></a><strong>The Dos and Don’ts of Daily Vlogging</strong></h2><h4 id="1-Do-Get-Some-Experience-First"><a href="#1-Do-Get-Some-Experience-First" class="headerlink" title="1. Do Get Some Experience First"></a><strong>1. Do Get Some Experience First</strong></h4><p>If you are starting out on YouTube, as in, you made one or two videos make sure you can vlog weekly for a few months before moving to daily. You wouldn’t run a marathon without training; you can hurt yourself if you do. Have an idea of what you are getting yourself into, otherwise, it can burn you out and ruin the joy of video creation for you completely.</p><h4 id="2-Don’t-Film-Everything"><a href="#2-Don’t-Film-Everything" class="headerlink" title="2. Don’t Film Everything"></a><strong>2. Don’t Film Everything</strong></h4><p>Having a daily vlog does not mean always having the camera on. Every minute you film is a minute of footage you will have to watch later, a minute you will have to decide whether to cut from your final video. Every second of recorded footage is multiplied in the editing room and it would be impossible for you to meet your daily deadline if you have too much. The key is to start editing as you film, that way, you only film what you need. It doesn’t hurt to have extra footage, but being excessive can waste your time and add little to the final product.</p><h4 id="3-Do-Plan-Out-Your-Day-Not-Your-Night"><a href="#3-Do-Plan-Out-Your-Day-Not-Your-Night" class="headerlink" title="3. Do Plan Out Your Day (Not Your Night)"></a><strong>3. Do Plan Out Your Day (Not Your Night)</strong></h4><p>Knowing where you need to go, who you are going to see and talk to, where you are going to have lunch, which route you are going to take home, and any other occurrences that can happen during the day will greatly increase your chances of success. A day is long and can be made longer when you have a video on your mind. Wouldn’t it be nice to save some of your decision making energy by having it all planned out? And if you are worried that over planning will reduce serendipitous moments that you want, don’t, your day won’t always go as planned… that’s just life.</p><p>Additionally, avoid filming at night. It will become a major stress to your health. Filming at night means pulling all-nighters to publish the next day, and then repeating that daily (nightly).</p><h4 id="4-Don’t-Spend-too-Long-On-a-Script…-Or-Your-Video"><a href="#4-Don’t-Spend-too-Long-On-a-Script…-Or-Your-Video" class="headerlink" title="4. Don’t Spend too Long On a Script… Or Your Video"></a><strong>4. Don’t Spend too Long On a Script… Or Your Video</strong></h4><p>The beauty of daily vlog is to speak your mind and show your personality, not to perform a Shakespearean sonnet by heart. You shouldn’t try to memorize a whole script every day. That would be brutal! What you can have is an outline of the key points you want to hit, certain things you want to say, convey, or record to tell your story, knowing where you want certain cuts to happen helps too, but don’t workshop it too long, because tomorrow will be another show and done is better than perfect.</p><h4 id="5-Do-Use-Templates-Presets-Hotkeys-and-Shortcuts"><a href="#5-Do-Use-Templates-Presets-Hotkeys-and-Shortcuts" class="headerlink" title="5. Do Use Templates, Presets, Hotkeys, and Shortcuts"></a><strong>5. Do Use Templates, Presets, Hotkeys, and Shortcuts</strong></h4><p>Any chance you have to cut down on your editing time, use it. This means creating and properly storing templates of visuals you want to incorporate into your video. This means adding presets for effects that you feel you would use again. This means learning the editing hotkeys so you can streamline your process. Here are <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora’s hotkeys <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h4 id="6-Don’t-Forget-to-Label-Your-Content"><a href="#6-Don’t-Forget-to-Label-Your-Content" class="headerlink" title="6. Don’t Forget to Label Your Content"></a><strong>6. Don’t Forget to Label Your Content</strong></h4><p>Staying organized is so important, especially as you begin to accumulate more and more footage. It might seem tedious initially, but this good habit can save you a lot of wasted hours later on when you need to find that specific shot that you swore you had…</p><h4 id="7-Do-Have-A-Goal"><a href="#7-Do-Have-A-Goal" class="headerlink" title="7. Do Have A Goal"></a><strong>7. Do Have A Goal</strong></h4><p>Have an idea of how long you are going to be going daily. Will it be one month, two months, or a year? Or will it be until you reach a certain amount of views, subscribers, or watch time? While it might feel liberating to venture into the great unknown without a clear destination, having a goal will allow you to keep motivated even when times are hard. After all, once you’ve hit your goal and still feel like there is more fuel in you, keep daily vlogging. There is no better feeling than exceeding your own expectations.</p><h4 id="8-Don’t-Worry-About-Equipment-But-Be-Aware-of-Bad-Audio"><a href="#8-Don’t-Worry-About-Equipment-But-Be-Aware-of-Bad-Audio" class="headerlink" title="8. Don’t Worry About Equipment (But Be Aware of Bad Audio)"></a><strong>8. Don’t Worry About Equipment (But Be Aware of Bad Audio)</strong></h4><p>You’ve heard it before: you don’t need anything fancy to be a vlogger. If you are looking to increase your toolbox, we have a helpful <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube gear starter guide <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for you. But look at it this way, there will be days when you realized that you forgot to charge the battery on your camera or that you left your tripod at home. Don’t abandon the whole project simply because you don’t have what you need.</p><p>The important thing is to film, tell a story, edit, and upload. You can do all that on your smartphone or computer webcam if you have to, so don’t let your equipment or lack thereof break your streak. If there is one thing you should put attention on is audio, if you don’t have excellent gear, try to avoid filming in loud places, such as construction sites, dance halls, or highway overpasses.</p><h4 id="9-Do-Bring-a-Camera-With-You-Everywhere"><a href="#9-Do-Bring-a-Camera-With-You-Everywhere" class="headerlink" title="9. Do Bring a Camera With You Everywhere"></a><strong>9. Do Bring a Camera With You Everywhere</strong></h4><p>Although you shouldn’t worry about your equipment, it is still a good habit to carry your camera with you everywhere. From the moment you wake up to the moment you go to sleep you are a daily vlogger, you never know when something will happen. Always be prepared. Your camera is to you, as a gun is to a soldier. It’s what sets you apart from all the civilians, so keep it close at hand.</p><h4 id="10-Don’t-Neglect-Your-Health"><a href="#10-Don’t-Neglect-Your-Health" class="headerlink" title="10. Don’t Neglect Your Health"></a><strong>10. Don’t Neglect Your Health</strong></h4><p>Earlier I compared daily vlogging to running a marathon, and like a marathon, there is a point where you need to be aware of yourself. You want to push yourself, but you don’t want to overdo it to a point where you damage your physical or mental health. Only you know when you have gone too far. If you feel like daily vlogging is ruining your life and the goal you set for yourself isn’t something you desire anymore, ask yourself: can I take a week off and decide if video creating is something I want to continue?</p><h4 id="11-Do-Watch-Other-Daily-Vloggers"><a href="#11-Do-Watch-Other-Daily-Vloggers" class="headerlink" title="11. Do Watch Other Daily Vloggers"></a><strong>11. Do Watch Other Daily Vloggers</strong></h4><p>By seeing how other YouTubers have done daily vlogs, you can get ideas, see what aspect of their videos you like or dislike, and learn from their presentation, content, and community engagement. By watching daily vloggers, you can also start interacting with their content as well. It is always easier to stay motivated when you have support. By watching and reaching out to the daily vloggers you enjoy, you can build a network of people who are going through the same journey as you.</p><h4 id="12-Don’t-Forget-About-Your-Audience"><a href="#12-Don’t-Forget-About-Your-Audience" class="headerlink" title="12. Don’t Forget About Your Audience"></a><strong>12. Don’t Forget About Your Audience</strong></h4><p>Remember that in the end, you are creating videos for someone else to enjoy. Even though you might be doing the daily vlog for yourself, if you want your viewers to return every day, you have to have an overall mission for your project. Is your message one that is aimed to motivate or do you want to document a journey? Don’t create your content in a vacuum, ask your viewers for feedback so you know how to improve.</p><p>Embarking on your daily vlogging adventure is not one to take lightly, but after 1 month, 1 season, or 1 year, you will be able to look back and see all that you have accomplished and feel proud. With the advice from this article, you can properly prepare yourself and enjoy each step of the process. Don’t overthink it, have fun!</p><p><em>Are you thinking of starting your daily vlog?

Sony’s Cyber-shot series is famous for its cutting-edge features and the DSC-RX 100 V model is not an exception. This camera is equipped with a 20.1 MP Exmor RS BSI CMOS Sensor that supports ISO sensitivities up to ISO 12800. You can record footage in UHD 4K at 30 or 24 fps, although with a five-minute limit, as well as Full HD videos at a maximum of 960 fps when recording in the HFR mode. The Sony Cyber-shot DSC-RX 100 V ships with a non-interchangeable Carl Zeiss Vario Sonnar T lens that performs well under low-light conditions and in broad daylight. The camera features a fast hybrid AF system with 315 phase-detection points and an anti-motion blur mode that allows you to keep the subjects of your vlogs in focus throughout your recording. DSC RX-100 V’s multi-functionality makes it one of the best cameras for daily vlogging, especially for vloggers who are planning on shooting vlogs in various locations.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- Light and easy to carry around</em> <em>- Produces high-res videos</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- Short battery life</em> <em>- Lacking a touchscreen</em></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlogging-camera-4.png"                      alt="Canon M100"                ></td><td>Best cheap vlogging camera: Canon EOS M100 Canon’s EOS M100 is small and powerful. This mirrorless camera produces full HD videos at 60 fps. It doesn’t, however, shoot 4K footage. The 24.2 MP APS-C CMOS sensor and the DIGIC 7 image processor ensure that your vlogs are always in focus and rich in detail. The Canon EOS M100 provides great ISO sensitivity options, offering ISO values as high as 25600, making it a great option for vloggers that often shoot their videos under difficult light conditions. The 3-inch touchscreen LCD lets you control focus points, navigate through the camera’s menu, or watch videos you’ve created. The screen can also be tilted in the upward direction to provide you a better preview of the shot you’re recording. The camera has a built-in Wi-Fi with NFC so you can transfer your videos seamlessly to a computer and have fun in the process. The Canon EOS M100 is currently one of the best entry-level cameras for daily vlogging on the market because it produces videos in great picture quality that you don’t have to spend a fortune for.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- Affordable</em> <em>- Great connectivity options</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- Lacks advanced video recording features</em> <em>- No viewfinder</em></td></tr><tr><td><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlogging-camera-4.png"                      alt="Canon M100"                ></td><td>Best entry-level mirrorless camera for vlogging: Canon EOS M100 The Canon EOS M100 wins this category as well in our books because it’s a powerful, feature-rich camera that’s also very affordable.

This camera uses the Canon EF lens mount, so you can choose the lens that best suits your needs. The Canon EOS M50 can capture UHD 4K videos at 23.98 fps, and it also lets you record 120 fps slow-motion videos at 720p.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- Has an external microphone port</em> <em>- Has a 2.36m-dot OLED electronic viewfinder</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- No image stabilization</em> <em>- Battery life could be longer</em></td></tr><tr><td><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlogging-camera-2.png"                      alt="Panasonic GH5S"                ></td><td>Best professional mirrorless camera for vlogging: Panasonic Lumix DC-GH5S The Panasonic’s GH series was made famous by the LUMIX DMC-GH4 model that will be remembered as the world’s first mirrorless interchangeable lens camera to offer the 4K video recording option. That’s why it comes as no surprise that the GH5S mirrorless micro four-thirds camera can record UHD 4K as well as DCI videos at 60 fps, and 150 Mbps. The full HD 1080p at 240 fps video recording option is also available if you want to capture slow-motion footage for your vlogs. The camera’s 10.28MP multi-aspect ratio MOS sensor enhances its low-light performance and produces high-quality videos even under very challenging lighting conditions. Recording the audio with an external microphone is one of the many advantages offered by the Lumix DC-GH5S, while the Advanced Depth-From-Focus technology is used to automatically focus the video in a fraction of a second. The GH5S’ touchscreen can be rotated in any direction, so you can clearly see your shot no matter where you are. There’s very little doubt that the GH5S is the best professional-level mirrorless camera for vlogging that will help you capture stunning vlogs.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- ISO sensitivity goes up to 204800</em> <em>- High video bit rates</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- Expensive</em> <em>- The camera body weighs about 1.5 lbs</em></td></tr><tr><td><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlogging-camera-1.png"                      alt="Canon SL2"                ></td><td>Best entry-level DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS SL2 The Canon EOS Rebel SL2 is a great entry-level vlogging camera that delivers great power at a low price.

This camera can capture full HD 1080p videos at 60 fps, and it features a 9-point AF system and dual pixel CMOS AF technologies that provide precise and quick focusing even when there is not much light. The SL2 also has a microphone jack you can connect an external microphone too for better audio.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- Microphone jack</em> <em>- Wi-Fi connectivity</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- No 4K video support</em> <em>- Optical image stabilizer could be better</em></td></tr><tr><td><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlogging-camera-11.png"                      alt="Canon 80D"                ></td><td>Best mid-range DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS 80D The Canon EOS 80D is a feature-rich, mid-range DSLR camera great for vlogging. The 80D lets you capture full HD 1080p videos at 60 fps. It doesn’t provide support for 4K videos, though. The ISO on this camera can be set up to 25600. The 24.2 MP APS-C CMOS sensor and the DIGIC 6 image processor reduce the need for high ISO values, though, as they enable the camera to capture visually stunning footage even when the light in the shot is far from perfect. The 80D’s 45-point all cross phase detection autofocus system and its dual pixel CMOS AF system enable you to produce sharp images without having to pull-focus yourself. The various-angle 3-inch 1.04M-dot ClearView II LCD touchscreen display, as well as the pentaprism type intelligent viewfinder, let you compose shots effortlessly.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- Feature-rich</em> <em>- Continuous AF feature performs beautifully while recording high-res videos</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- Just one SD card slot</em> <em>- PC sync connection features could be better</em></td></tr><tr><td><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlogging-camera-5.png"                      alt="Canon 6D Mark II"                ></td><td>Best professional DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon 6D Mark II The Canon EOS 6D Mark II is the best professional DSLR camera for vlogging. It is the only DSLR camera on the market (as of writing this review) that comes with a full-frame sensor along with a fully-articulated screen and a microphone jack. The camera’s 26.2 MP full-frame CMOS sensor can take in much more light, giving you the option to shoot with higher quality bokeh (unfocused areas appearing more blurry) and find focus much more quickly and accurately in more challenging lighting conditions. With this camera, you can shoot up to full HD 1080p videos at a maximum of 60 fps. Although the 6D Mark II comes with the same 45-point all cross-type autofocusing system as Canon’s crop sensor 80D camera, the 6D Mark II is equipped with the improved DIGIC 7 image processor unlike the 80D’s DIGIC 6 image processor. If you’re wanting to shoot your vlogs with a full-frame, The 6D Mark II is a great option.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- ISO sensitivity goes up to 102400</em> <em>- Amazing touchscreen controls</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- No 4K video recording option</em> <em>- No USB 3.0</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-AIMmjowaFs4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABc/Y5UmwDaI7HU/s250-c-k/photo.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Liza Brown</p><p>Liza Brown is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Liza Brown</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/ed-the-ultimate-comparison-of-gif-creators-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] The Ultimate Comparison of GIF Creators for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-avoid-shaky-footage-proper-tripod-usage-techniques-in-vlog-creation/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Avoid Shaky Footage  Proper Tripod Usage Techniques in Vlog Creation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/n-2024-maximize-youtube-traction-affordable-audience-expansion/"><u>[New] In 2024, Maximize YouTube Traction  Affordable Audience Expansion</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/al-visual-branding-best-practices-for-youtube-channel-size/"><u>Optimal Visual Branding  Best Practices for YouTube Channel Size</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/-fixes-todays-rapidly-watched-videos-for-2024/"><u>Quick Fixes  Today's Rapidly Watched Videos for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/erfect-guide-youtube-videos-on-instagram-feed-for-2024/"><u>[New] Perfect Guide  YouTube Videos on Instagram Feed for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/ow-to-craft-top-quality-youtube-thumbnails-fast-for-2024/"><u>[New] How To Craft Top Quality YouTube Thumbnails Fast for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-your-path-to-youtube-earnings-setting-up-and-selling-content/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Your Path to YouTube Earnings  Setting Up and Selling Content</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/new-36-epic-tiktok-comedy-moments-for-2024/"><u>[New] 36 Epic TikTok Comedy Moments for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-ai-editor.techidaily.com/cut-and-edit-3gp-files-with-ease-updated-2023/"><u>Cut and Edit 3GP Files with Ease Updated 2023</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-unleash-the-full-potential-of-your-images-with-instagram-filters/"><u>[New] In 2024, Unleash the Full Potential of Your Images with Instagram Filters</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-low-cost-hardware-obs-optimization-tips/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Low-Cost Hardware  OBS Optimization Tips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://bypass-frp.techidaily.com/in-2024-addrom-bypass-an-android-tool-to-unlock-frp-lock-screen-for-your-infinix-smart-8-pro-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, AddROM Bypass An Android Tool to Unlock FRP Lock Screen For your Infinix Smart 8 Pro</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/the-fastest-path-to-amazing-iphone-time-lapses-for-2024/"><u>The Fastest Path to Amazing iPhone Time-Lapses for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/2024-approved-social-media-sensations-top-10-subscribers-list/"><u>2024 Approved  Social Media Sensations  Top 10 Subscribers List</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-redefine-your-online-persona-with-a-new-tiktok-profile/"><u>[Updated] Redefine Your Online Persona with a New TikTok Profile</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/a-complete-guide-to-oem-unlocking-on-samsung-galaxy-s23-by-drfone-android/"><u>A Complete Guide To OEM Unlocking on Samsung Galaxy S23</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Quick-Fix-From-Raw-Images-To-High-Quality-YouTube-Thumbnails"><a href="#Quick-Fix-From-Raw-Images-To-High-Quality-YouTube-Thumbnails" class="headerlink" title="Quick Fix: From Raw Images To High-Quality YouTube Thumbnails"></a>Quick Fix: From Raw Images To High-Quality YouTube Thumbnails</h2><p>There is a saying that first impressions last, and this is proven true, especially when it comes to YouTube video viewership. For sure, you have experienced watching a video out of curiosity because of its thumbnail. That is why content creators take time to resize YouTube thumbnails or use a YouTube thumbnail size converter to customize the preview images that represent their videos.</p><p>This technique not only attract viewers to watch your video, but it also gives a glimpse of your content. In this article, we will provide you with a quick tutorial on how to resize a YouTube thumbnail and suggest handy tools you can use to create the perfect YouTube video thumbnail!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/resize-youtube-thumbnail.jpg"                      alt="youtube thumbnail resize"                ></p><h2 id="Best-YouTube-Thumbnail-Size"><a href="#Best-YouTube-Thumbnail-Size" class="headerlink" title="Best YouTube Thumbnail Size"></a>Best YouTube Thumbnail Size</h2><p>According to YouTube’s help center, there are some things to remember when creating a thumbnail for your YouTube videos.</p><ul><li>First, make sure that the thumbnail size is 1280 pixels by 720 pixels and 640 pixels wide. It is the best YouTube thumbnail size.</li><li>When it comes to the thumbnail dimension, make sure to use an aspect ratio of 16:9.</li><li>Also, your YouTube thumbnail image should not exceed 2MB and is in either JPG, GIF or PNG format.</li></ul><h2 id="How-To-Resize-Your-YouTube-Thumbnail"><a href="#How-To-Resize-Your-YouTube-Thumbnail" class="headerlink" title="How To Resize Your YouTube Thumbnail"></a>How To Resize Your YouTube Thumbnail</h2><p>The primary reason for changing the YouTube thumbnail size is to gain more audience. If you are a content creator, your main goal is to introduce your content to a wider range of viewers, right? So you have to pay attention to even the smallest detail, such as YouTube thumbnails to increase viewership and top YouTube SEO.</p><p>In fact, YouTube recommends this technique to get more viewers. Also, resizing your YouTube thumbnail will prevent you from getting the “file larger than 2MB error” which can cause your thumbnail to be discarded.</p><p>So, how can you use this technique? Check our tutorial below as we walk you through various recommended methods for resizing a YouTube thumbnail:</p><h3 id="Method-1-Resize-YouTube-Thumbnail-With-Windows-Default-App"><a href="#Method-1-Resize-YouTube-Thumbnail-With-Windows-Default-App" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Resize YouTube Thumbnail With Windows Default App"></a>Method 1: Resize YouTube Thumbnail With Windows Default App</h3><p>The easiest way to resize YouTube thumbnails is through the Windows default app. Within just a few modifications, you can resize your thumbnail to fit as a preview image for your YouTube video.</p><p>Please take note that your image should be at least 2 megabytes or less to achieve the perfect YouTube thumbnail fit. If your image exceeds the limit, your thumbnail will either be rejected, or your image will have a black screen around it-which is not ideal at all.</p><p>Now, let us start the tutorial.</p><p>Step1 Open an image you want to set as a thumbnail. Then, <strong>Right-click&gt; Resize.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/photo-for-youtube-thumbnail-resize.JPG"                      alt="select image for youtube thumbnail resize"                ></p><p>Step2 Select “Define custom dimensions.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-thumbnail-resize-dimensions.jpg"                      alt="youtube thumbnail custom dimensions"                ></p><p>Step3 Set the width to <strong>1280</strong> and the height to <strong>720</strong>. Then <strong>tick</strong> the box for “<strong>Maintain Aspect Ratio</strong> “and <strong>click “Save Resized Copy.”</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-thumbnail-resize-ratio.jpg"                      alt="setting image width and height"                ></p><p>Step4 Click the upload thumbnail button on YouTube and <strong>import</strong> your resized image.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-thumbnail-resize-finished.jpg"                      alt="upload resized thumbnail in youtube"                ></p><h3 id="Method-2-Online-YouTube-Thumbnail-Size-Converter"><a href="#Method-2-Online-YouTube-Thumbnail-Size-Converter" class="headerlink" title="Method 2.

Using an image editing program can be a good option if you need more control over the appearance of your thumbnail or if you want to make more extensive edits beyond simply resizing the image.</p><p>To resize an image using an image editing program like GIMP, follow these steps:</p><p>Step1 Install and <strong>launch</strong> GIMP on your computer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gimp-install.JPG"                      alt="gimp install"                ></p><p>Step2 Click on “<strong>File</strong>“ &gt; “<strong>Open</strong>,” then search for the file you want to resize.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gimp-open-thumbnail.JPG"                      alt="gimp open thumbnail"                ></p><p>Step3 Click on “<strong>Image</strong>“ &gt; “<strong>Scale Image</strong>“ and make sure that the resolution is 1920 by 1080.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gimp-edit-resolution.JPG"                      alt="gimp edit resolution"                ></p><p>Step4 Click on “<strong>File</strong>“ &gt; “<strong>Export As</strong>“ and <strong>toggle</strong> the “<strong>Select File Type (By Extension)</strong>“ option. <strong>Choose</strong> JPG&#x2F;JPEG format because it can compress the thumbnail enough to stay within the limit of 2 megabytes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gimp-export-format.JPG"                      alt="gimp export format"                ></p><p>Step5 You can change the quality of the image and <strong>click</strong> the “<strong>Export</strong>“ button to save the thumbnail.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gimp-export-thumbnail.JPG"                      alt="gimp export thumbnail"                ></p><h2 id="Comparison-of-These-4-YouTube-Thumbnail-Resizing-Methods"><a href="#Comparison-of-These-4-YouTube-Thumbnail-Resizing-Methods" class="headerlink" title="Comparison of These 4 YouTube Thumbnail Resizing Methods"></a>Comparison of These 4 YouTube Thumbnail Resizing Methods</h2><p>Now that we’ve explored the four methods for resizing YouTube thumbnails, it’s time to compare the pros and cons of each method.

Instead of just looking at the end plan, you are building your platform up through short attainable goals. There is immense power in setting short term goals. Some serious questions that you should ask yourself are:</p><p><strong><em>Step 1:</em></strong> Start with the question of why you need a YouTube channel in the first place! Decide on what your channel should be about and how the viewers are going to benefit from it.</p><p><strong><em>Step 2:</em></strong> The next step is to prepare a content plan. Here must decide the type of videos and how often it will be published on your channel.</p><p><strong><em>Step 3:</em></strong> What is your target in terms of subscribers and traffic conversion.

Test video duration"></a>a. Test video duration</h3><p>Nobody likes to see a 2 hour long YouTube video unless it’s super interesting. Thankfully, there have been <a class="link"   href="https://www.minimatters.com/youtube-best-video-length/" >studies <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that have been conducted to measure the audience reaction to videos of different lengths.</p><p>By default, when you create a YouTube account, the maximum upload length is restricted to just 15 minutes. You can go past this limit by verifying your account on YouTube.</p><p>When you look at the most trending videos on YouTube, they generally fall within 10 minutes. The average video size on YouTube is 4.4 minutes .</p><p>For example, let us look at YouTube videos that explain the same concept, but with different video lengths and see if the audience engagement differs with the videos. we have ensured that both videos are from channels who have a similar subscriber count in order to eliminate disproportionality that arises from viewer base.</p><p>This video gives an excellent explanation of the string theory. The Video is From TED-Ed and you can see the audience response in the comments where they praise Physicist Brian Greene for his talk.

These new formats can be in the form of a separate video series that is different from your main content. It can also be something that directly engages the viewers like a live video stream, Ask Me Anything or Q&amp;A type of content, etc.</p><p>For example, let us take one among the most popular cooking channels on YouTube – Tasty. If you were to browse through their content, you can see how they got their fame with cookery videos that are short and sweet like the one below:</p><p>However, they do not just stick to that same format all the time. you can also see how they mix in lengthier videos of different format.

It just has to offer enough options to make the process of making a vlog as smooth as it can possibly be. The T7i is not the most powerful DSLR camera out there, but its 24.2 MP APS-C CMOS sensor and a DIGIC 7 image processor are more than enough to meet the needs of most daily vloggers. You can record full HD 1080p videos at 60 fps and use this camera to create HDR and time-lapse movies. You can set the T7i’s ISO up as high as 51200, which is pretty good. The T7i’s dual pixel CMOS AF system makes sure that the camera focuses quickly and it helps you avoid creating video clips that are out focus. There’s also a built-in Wi-FI with an NFC feature that enables you to share your videos with a smartphone device you connect to the camera.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- Long battery life</em> <em>- Remarkable image quality at high ISO values</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- Can’t record 4K videos</em> <em>- Viewfinder is tiny</em></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canon-eos-rebel2.png"                      alt="Canon SL2"                ></td><td>Best entry-level DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS SL2 The Canon EOS SL2 was released just a year ago and it wins our 2018 vote for the best entry-level DSLR camera for vlogging. The SL2 packs a lot of features in a compact camera body. The camera only weighs 1 lb, which is considered light among most DSLR cameras. Many vloggers may enjoy the fact that they can hold up this light camera in front of themselves with more ease. Like a lot of entry-level DSLR cameras, the SL2 comes with an APS-C crop sensor. With ISO capabilities that can reach up to 51200, you’ll be able to film up to full HD 1080p videos at 60 fps, even under low light conditions. All recent Canon cameras perform very well when it comes to autofocus and the SL2 is no exception. It does, however, have fewer points of focus. The SL2 comes with a 9-point AF system. The SL2 also has a fully-articulated screen and a microphone jack.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- Microphone jack</em> <em>- Wi-Fi connectivity</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- No 4K video support</em> <em>- Optical image stabilizer could be better</em></td></tr><tr><td><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canon-eos-80d7.png"                      alt="Canon 80D"                ></td><td>Best mid-range DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS 80D The Canon EOS 80D is the successor of the 70D which was at one time considered by many YouTubers the ultimate DSLR camera for vlogging. The 80D is a larger camera than the SL2, weighing 1.61 lbs. In its larger build, this camera additionally (compared to the SL2) packs a 45-point AF system, longer battery life, a headphone port, and it is environmentally sealed so you can shoot in tough conditions. This camera’s great performance in autofocusing makes it a great mid-range DSLR camera for vlogging.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- Feature-rich</em> <em>- Continuous AF feature performs beautifully while recording high-res videos</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- Just one SD card slot</em> <em>- PC sync connection features could be better</em></td></tr><tr><td><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canon-eos-mark1.png"                      alt="Canon 6D Mark II"                ></td><td>Best professional DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS 6D Mark II There’s a lot of DSLR cameras that come with a fully-articulated screen and a microphone jack, but the Canon EOS 6D Mark II is actually the only one in the market that comes equipped with both of those, plus a full-frame sensor. It is its full-frame sensor that really sets this camera apart from the other vlogging DLSR cameras. Because of its full-frame sensor, this camera performs much better in low light conditions. With this larger sensor, you’ll also be able to capture footage that looks more cinematic with high-quality bokeh (more blur to your out-of-focus areas). The 6D Mark II also has great battery life compared to all the reviewed cameras above. Unfortunately, this camera does not shoot in 4K.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- ISO sensitivity goes up to 102400</em> <em>- Amazing touchscreen controls</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- No 4K video recording option</em> <em>- No USB 3.0</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Want to compare even more cameras?

It has supplied so much information that it took this <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >comprehensive post about Analytics <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to highlight all the insights. So why would YouTube change it?</p><p>Change to a popular social media platform is always worrisome to content creators because it means there will be a new learning phase forced upon them. While the Classic YouTube Creator Studio has a lot of features and functionality, the data was often hard to interpret and inconvenient to find. Many creators weren’t sure where their data was located or how to use the information presented to them.</p><p>YouTube Studio was designed to be a friendly management and analysis tool. YouTube also offers more guidance, showcasing the key metrics the algorithm uses to evaluate the success of a video more prominently. Additionally, the graphs presented offer more clarity, shortening the time a creator spends finding the information they need.</p><p>Undoubtedly, YouTube updated its Creator Studio to offer a tool that enables its users to better understand their video performance and make better content that serves YouTube’s requirements.</p><h2 id="Intro-to-YouTube-Studio-Beta"><a href="#Intro-to-YouTube-Studio-Beta" class="headerlink" title="Intro to YouTube Studio (Beta)"></a>Intro to YouTube Studio (Beta)</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-studio-beta.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Studio Beta"                ></p><p>YouTube Studio (Beta), for many YouTubers, is now the default. However, for the time being, creators can still switch back to the Classic view (as some of the features are still being built). YouTube’s objective is to receive data of their own by understanding how creators are using the new Studio and gaining feedback to improve upon it.</p><p>If you have any feedback, simply click on this button on the bottom left menu of the YouTube Studio (Beta) and send YouTube your thoughts.</p><p>In addition to the new layout of the tools and dashboards, YouTube Studio (Beta) will also debut 3 metrics for creators:</p><p><strong>1. Impressions</strong>: See the total reach of all your videos or each individual video. Each time your video thumbnail and title are visible to the user counts as an impression.</p><p><strong>2. Click-through rate</strong>: Determine how click-worthy your thumbnails and titles are, by seeing the percentage of people who click into your video.</p><p><strong>3. Unique viewers</strong>: Know how many different people have watched your videos. This data can be used to compare the size of your subscriber base to the actual number of your audience.</p><h2 id="Tips-for-Using-YouTube-Studio-Beta-Features"><a href="#Tips-for-Using-YouTube-Studio-Beta-Features" class="headerlink" title="Tips for Using YouTube Studio Beta Features"></a>Tips for Using YouTube Studio Beta Features</h2><p>Now that you are more familiar with the new YouTube Studio (Beta), let us dive into what you can accomplish with all the new features.</p><h4 id="1-Optimization-Tips"><a href="#1-Optimization-Tips" class="headerlink" title="1.

This means, the launch of your video matters.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-studio-beta-recent-video-data.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Studio Video Analysis"                ></p><h4 id="3-Video-Analysis"><a href="#3-Video-Analysis" class="headerlink" title="3. Video Analysis"></a>3. Video Analysis</h4><p>In the Classic Creator Studio, you couldn’t get an aggregated view of all the important video data on one dashboard. You would have to click to each set of analytics individually and then dive deeper. This ate up your precious content creation time and made it hard to combine insights. Now with Studio Beta, you can see all the critical data in one spot. Right away, you can see how that video is performing through different factors. This will let you know where audience retention is dropping off or which traffic source is supplying most of the views.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-studio-beta-video-analysis.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Studio Video Analysis"                ></p><h4 id="4-Watch-Time-Funnel"><a href="#4-Watch-Time-Funnel" class="headerlink" title="4. Watch Time Funnel"></a>4. Watch Time Funnel</h4><p>The objective is to increase watch time, the metric YouTube puts the most weight on. With the new Watch Time Funnel, which you can find in the Analytics section under the Reach Viewer dashboard, you can see exactly at which level of your channel or wherein an individual video you will need to improve.</p><p>If the impression numbers are low, that means you need to improve how your video is being discovered by doing more research to understand what your viewers are searching for.</p><p>If the click-through rate (CTR) is low, then you will have to improve your thumbnail and title. This will better entice your audience to click. According to Google, half of all videos have an average CTR of 2-10%.</p><p>If the average view duration is not up to your standards, then you will have to improve your content itself. While it is most ideal to have all your viewers watch all the way to the end of all your videos, that is certainly unrealistic. However, 60-70% is a great number to aim towards.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-studio-beta-watch-time-funnel.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Creator Studio Watch Time Funnel"                ></p><h4 id="5-Traffic-Sources"><a href="#5-Traffic-Sources" class="headerlink" title="5. Traffic Sources"></a>5. Traffic Sources</h4><p>YouTube now presents all the different traffic sources in one easy-to-find page in the Reach Viewer tab, so creators no longer have to click between them to analyze where their traffic is coming from. This new design is far less intimidating and messy. At a glance, you can now see where the majority of your audiences are coming from.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-studio-traffic-source.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Studio Traffic Source"                ></p><p>YouTube has always put a lot of value into its analytic tools, and with YouTube Studio Beta the features and design are continuously improving. Having better data and understanding of how an individual video or an entire channel is performing will help creators succeed on this ever more competitive platform.</p><p><em>Have you tried the new YouTube Studio (Beta)?

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Guide-for-Social-Media-Savvy-Content-Sharers"><a href="#Guide-for-Social-Media-Savvy-Content-Sharers" class="headerlink" title="Guide for Social Media Savvy Content Sharers"></a>Guide for Social Media Savvy Content Sharers</h2><p>YouTube has become the most popular video-sharing platform on the internet, with users from all over the world uploading and watching videos daily. You can find content on just about any topic you can think of on YouTube, making it an excellent resource for entertainment and education.</p><p>But what if you’ve created a playlist of your favorite videos and think your friends or family would enjoy it? To help you with this, we’ve put together an extensive guide on <strong>how to</strong> <strong>share a YouTube playlist</strong> on your computer and mobile devices.</p><p>So, let’s get started with our guide without any further delay!</p><h2 id="Why-Doesn’t-The-Share-Function-In-The-Playlist-Work"><a href="#Why-Doesn’t-The-Share-Function-In-The-Playlist-Work" class="headerlink" title="Why Doesn’t The Share Function In The Playlist Work?"></a>Why Doesn’t The Share Function In The Playlist Work?</h2><p>Firstly, let’s figure out why the “Share” function doesn’t work. The “Share” function in the playlist does not work because it is set to “private,” and YouTube doesn’t allow you to share them. To fix this, you must first change the privacy settings of the playlist to “public” in the following way:</p><p>Step1 Head to the <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/" >YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> website using a browser on your PC and sign in to your account.</p><p>Step2</p><ul><li><strong>Click</strong> the three-line <strong>“Menu”</strong> icon at the top-left of your screen.</li><li>Go to <strong>“Library.”</strong></li><li>Scroll down to the <strong>“Playlist”</strong> section.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/changing-playlist-visibility.png"                      alt="changing playlist visibility"                ></p><p>Step3 Select your playlist labeled as <strong>“Private.”</strong> On the next page, click the <strong>“Private”</strong> option in the playlist details section and select <strong>“Public”</strong> to change the visibility of your playlist.</p><p>Once the privacy setting has been changed, the <strong>“share”</strong> function will work as intended.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/making-youtube-playlist-public.png"                      alt="making youtube playlist public"                ></p><h2 id="How-To-Share-The-YouTube-Playlist"><a href="#How-To-Share-The-YouTube-Playlist" class="headerlink" title="How To Share The YouTube Playlist?"></a>How To Share The YouTube Playlist?</h2><p>If you want to share the playlist on YouTube using your computer or mobile device, read the instructions below carefully:</p><h3 id="1-For-Computers"><a href="#1-For-Computers" class="headerlink" title="1.

Here are the step-by-step instructions for achieving this task:</p><p>Step1 Visit the <strong>YouTube website</strong> using a browser on your computer and sign in to your account. Click your <strong>Profile</strong> in the top-right of the screen and select <strong>“Your Channel”</strong> from the drop-down menu, which will take you to your YouTube channel’s dashboard.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/accessing-youtube-channel-to-share-playlist.png"                      alt="accessing youtube channel to share playlist"                ></p><p>Step2 Next, go to the <strong>“Playlist”</strong> tab and click the <strong>“View Full Playlist”</strong> option under your playlist to access it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/sharing-own-youtube-playlist.png"                      alt="sharing own youtube playlist"                ></p><p>Step3 Finally, click the <strong>“Share”</strong> icon in the playlist’s details section, and a window will pop up.

Now, click the <strong>“Share”</strong> icon in the playlist’s details section, and a pop-up window will appear. In the <strong>“Share”</strong> section, copy the URL and paste it into an email, message, or social media post to share.</p><p>That’s all there is to it! Anyone you’ve shared the link with can watch the entire playlist.</p><h5 id="How-To-Share-The-Playlist-While-Watching"><a href="#How-To-Share-The-Playlist-While-Watching" class="headerlink" title="How To Share The Playlist While Watching?"></a>How To Share The Playlist While Watching?</h5><p>We all love using YouTube for research or just scrolling through videos to pass the time, and we often share our favorite videos with others. What if you wish to share a whole YouTube playlist while watching it?</p><p>Fortunately, there’s a simple and quick way to do this, and here are the step-by-step instructions for this method.</p><p>Step1 In the first step, head to the <strong>YouTube</strong> website using a browser and use the search bar to access the playlist.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/sharing-youtube-playlist-while-watching.png"                      alt="sharing youtube playlist while watching"                ></p><p>Step2 Click the playlist to start watching it.

It just has to offer enough options to make the process of making a vlog as smooth as it can possibly be. The T7i is not the most powerful DSLR camera out there, but its 24.2 MP APS-C CMOS sensor and a DIGIC 7 image processor are more than enough to meet the needs of most daily vloggers. You can record full HD 1080p videos at 60 fps and use this camera to create HDR and time-lapse movies. You can set the T7i’s ISO up as high as 51200, which is pretty good. The T7i’s dual pixel CMOS AF system makes sure that the camera focuses quickly and it helps you avoid creating video clips that are out focus. There’s also a built-in Wi-FI with an NFC feature that enables you to share your videos with a smartphone device you connect to the camera.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- Long battery life</em> <em>- Remarkable image quality at high ISO values</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- Can’t record 4K videos</em> <em>- Viewfinder is tiny</em></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canon-eos-rebel2.png"                      alt="Canon SL2"                ></td><td>Best entry-level DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS SL2 The Canon EOS SL2 was released just a year ago and it wins our 2018 vote for the best entry-level DSLR camera for vlogging. The SL2 packs a lot of features in a compact camera body. The camera only weighs 1 lb, which is considered light among most DSLR cameras. Many vloggers may enjoy the fact that they can hold up this light camera in front of themselves with more ease. Like a lot of entry-level DSLR cameras, the SL2 comes with an APS-C crop sensor. With ISO capabilities that can reach up to 51200, you’ll be able to film up to full HD 1080p videos at 60 fps, even under low light conditions. All recent Canon cameras perform very well when it comes to autofocus and the SL2 is no exception. It does, however, have fewer points of focus. The SL2 comes with a 9-point AF system. The SL2 also has a fully-articulated screen and a microphone jack.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- Microphone jack</em> <em>- Wi-Fi connectivity</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- No 4K video support</em> <em>- Optical image stabilizer could be better</em></td></tr><tr><td><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canon-eos-80d7.png"                      alt="Canon 80D"                ></td><td>Best mid-range DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS 80D The Canon EOS 80D is the successor of the 70D which was at one time considered by many YouTubers the ultimate DSLR camera for vlogging. The 80D is a larger camera than the SL2, weighing 1.61 lbs. In its larger build, this camera additionally (compared to the SL2) packs a 45-point AF system, longer battery life, a headphone port, and it is environmentally sealed so you can shoot in tough conditions. This camera’s great performance in autofocusing makes it a great mid-range DSLR camera for vlogging.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- Feature-rich</em> <em>- Continuous AF feature performs beautifully while recording high-res videos</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- Just one SD card slot</em> <em>- PC sync connection features could be better</em></td></tr><tr><td><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canon-eos-mark1.png"                      alt="Canon 6D Mark II"                ></td><td>Best professional DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS 6D Mark II There’s a lot of DSLR cameras that come with a fully-articulated screen and a microphone jack, but the Canon EOS 6D Mark II is actually the only one in the market that comes equipped with both of those, plus a full-frame sensor. It is its full-frame sensor that really sets this camera apart from the other vlogging DLSR cameras. Because of its full-frame sensor, this camera performs much better in low light conditions. With this larger sensor, you’ll also be able to capture footage that looks more cinematic with high-quality bokeh (more blur to your out-of-focus areas). The 6D Mark II also has great battery life compared to all the reviewed cameras above. Unfortunately, this camera does not shoot in 4K.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- ISO sensitivity goes up to 102400</em> <em>- Amazing touchscreen controls</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- No 4K video recording option</em> <em>- No USB 3.0</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Want to compare even more cameras?

You might have also watched some videos from influencers telling you that the ruthless YouTube algorithm demands daily content if you aspire to grow an audience.</p><p>There are many reasons why you may want to try your hand at becoming a daily vlogger, but here are 3 motivating reasons to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >conquer your vlogging fears <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and get started.</p><h2 id="Bonus-Tip-The-Best-Daily-Vlog-Maker-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#Bonus-Tip-The-Best-Daily-Vlog-Maker-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Tip-The Best Daily Vlog Maker- Wondershare Filmora"></a>Bonus Tip-The Best Daily Vlog Maker- Wondershare Filmora</h2><p>Vlogging is an art and people use vlogging to upload videos daily to their YouTube channel. This is natural if you are recording videos daily, you will need a tool like Wondershare Filmora to edit your videos with precision. To make your task easy, Wondershare Filmora has all the features and effects that are required to edit a daily vlog video that you can upload directly from Filmora itself. You can make use of features like add text, background music, filters &amp; effects, etc if you are a daily vlogger as it would help you a lot in making the video look professional in less time.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Mac Version"                > </a></p><h2 id="Why-Daily-Vlog-Anyways"><a href="#Why-Daily-Vlog-Anyways" class="headerlink" title="Why Daily Vlog Anyways?"></a><strong>Why Daily Vlog Anyways?</strong></h2><p> <strong>Build discipline</strong>: Like exercising and eating healthy, you have to commit to it and do it regularly in order to see any lasting results. Vlogging is the same. However, if you’re a creator, making videos whenever you feel like it and want to give yourself a kick in the behind, daily vlogging is a practice that will keep you accountable. You have to do it every day. No excuses.</p><p><strong>Practice more</strong>: How do the best become the best? They practice… every day. If what you want to do is become the greatest video creator you can be, make the best videos you can make, and build the largest following that you can, then let daily vlogging be your boot camp to reach those goals.</p><p><strong>Please the YouTube algorithm</strong>: It’s true, YouTube wants to see that you are consistently posting fresh content. Every new video you upload will have a day or two to impress the algorithm, this metric is often referred to as <a class="link"   href="https://youtu.be/Kj7L%5FfXhifw" >view velocity <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. YouTube will give your video a lift, suggesting it to new viewers, if they see that it is being enjoyed. By publishing daily, you increase your chances of attracting more viewers.</p><p>Now that you know the benefits, how should you approach it?</p><h2 id="The-Dos-and-Don’ts-of-Daily-Vlogging-1"><a href="#The-Dos-and-Don’ts-of-Daily-Vlogging-1" class="headerlink" title="The Dos and Don’ts of Daily Vlogging"></a><strong>The Dos and Don’ts of Daily Vlogging</strong></h2><h4 id="1-Do-Get-Some-Experience-First"><a href="#1-Do-Get-Some-Experience-First" class="headerlink" title="1. Do Get Some Experience First"></a><strong>1. Do Get Some Experience First</strong></h4><p>If you are starting out on YouTube, as in, you made one or two videos make sure you can vlog weekly for a few months before moving to daily. You wouldn’t run a marathon without training; you can hurt yourself if you do. Have an idea of what you are getting yourself into, otherwise, it can burn you out and ruin the joy of video creation for you completely.</p><h4 id="2-Don’t-Film-Everything"><a href="#2-Don’t-Film-Everything" class="headerlink" title="2. Don’t Film Everything"></a><strong>2. Don’t Film Everything</strong></h4><p>Having a daily vlog does not mean always having the camera on. Every minute you film is a minute of footage you will have to watch later, a minute you will have to decide whether to cut from your final video. Every second of recorded footage is multiplied in the editing room and it would be impossible for you to meet your daily deadline if you have too much. The key is to start editing as you film, that way, you only film what you need. It doesn’t hurt to have extra footage, but being excessive can waste your time and add little to the final product.</p><h4 id="3-Do-Plan-Out-Your-Day-Not-Your-Night"><a href="#3-Do-Plan-Out-Your-Day-Not-Your-Night" class="headerlink" title="3. Do Plan Out Your Day (Not Your Night)"></a><strong>3. Do Plan Out Your Day (Not Your Night)</strong></h4><p>Knowing where you need to go, who you are going to see and talk to, where you are going to have lunch, which route you are going to take home, and any other occurrences that can happen during the day will greatly increase your chances of success. A day is long and can be made longer when you have a video on your mind. Wouldn’t it be nice to save some of your decision making energy by having it all planned out? And if you are worried that over planning will reduce serendipitous moments that you want, don’t, your day won’t always go as planned… that’s just life.</p><p>Additionally, avoid filming at night. It will become a major stress to your health. Filming at night means pulling all-nighters to publish the next day, and then repeating that daily (nightly).</p><h4 id="4-Don’t-Spend-too-Long-On-a-Script…-Or-Your-Video"><a href="#4-Don’t-Spend-too-Long-On-a-Script…-Or-Your-Video" class="headerlink" title="4. Don’t Spend too Long On a Script… Or Your Video"></a><strong>4. Don’t Spend too Long On a Script… Or Your Video</strong></h4><p>The beauty of daily vlog is to speak your mind and show your personality, not to perform a Shakespearean sonnet by heart. You shouldn’t try to memorize a whole script every day. That would be brutal! What you can have is an outline of the key points you want to hit, certain things you want to say, convey, or record to tell your story, knowing where you want certain cuts to happen helps too, but don’t workshop it too long, because tomorrow will be another show and done is better than perfect.</p><h4 id="5-Do-Use-Templates-Presets-Hotkeys-and-Shortcuts"><a href="#5-Do-Use-Templates-Presets-Hotkeys-and-Shortcuts" class="headerlink" title="5. Do Use Templates, Presets, Hotkeys, and Shortcuts"></a><strong>5. Do Use Templates, Presets, Hotkeys, and Shortcuts</strong></h4><p>Any chance you have to cut down on your editing time, use it. This means creating and properly storing templates of visuals you want to incorporate into your video. This means adding presets for effects that you feel you would use again. This means learning the editing hotkeys so you can streamline your process. Here are <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora’s hotkeys <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h4 id="6-Don’t-Forget-to-Label-Your-Content"><a href="#6-Don’t-Forget-to-Label-Your-Content" class="headerlink" title="6. Don’t Forget to Label Your Content"></a><strong>6. Don’t Forget to Label Your Content</strong></h4><p>Staying organized is so important, especially as you begin to accumulate more and more footage. It might seem tedious initially, but this good habit can save you a lot of wasted hours later on when you need to find that specific shot that you swore you had…</p><h4 id="7-Do-Have-A-Goal"><a href="#7-Do-Have-A-Goal" class="headerlink" title="7. Do Have A Goal"></a><strong>7. Do Have A Goal</strong></h4><p>Have an idea of how long you are going to be going daily. Will it be one month, two months, or a year? Or will it be until you reach a certain amount of views, subscribers, or watch time? While it might feel liberating to venture into the great unknown without a clear destination, having a goal will allow you to keep motivated even when times are hard. After all, once you’ve hit your goal and still feel like there is more fuel in you, keep daily vlogging. There is no better feeling than exceeding your own expectations.</p><h4 id="8-Don’t-Worry-About-Equipment-But-Be-Aware-of-Bad-Audio"><a href="#8-Don’t-Worry-About-Equipment-But-Be-Aware-of-Bad-Audio" class="headerlink" title="8. Don’t Worry About Equipment (But Be Aware of Bad Audio)"></a><strong>8. Don’t Worry About Equipment (But Be Aware of Bad Audio)</strong></h4><p>You’ve heard it before: you don’t need anything fancy to be a vlogger. If you are looking to increase your toolbox, we have a helpful <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube gear starter guide <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for you. But look at it this way, there will be days when you realized that you forgot to charge the battery on your camera or that you left your tripod at home. Don’t abandon the whole project simply because you don’t have what you need.</p><p>The important thing is to film, tell a story, edit, and upload. You can do all that on your smartphone or computer webcam if you have to, so don’t let your equipment or lack thereof break your streak. If there is one thing you should put attention on is audio, if you don’t have excellent gear, try to avoid filming in loud places, such as construction sites, dance halls, or highway overpasses.</p><h4 id="9-Do-Bring-a-Camera-With-You-Everywhere"><a href="#9-Do-Bring-a-Camera-With-You-Everywhere" class="headerlink" title="9. Do Bring a Camera With You Everywhere"></a><strong>9. Do Bring a Camera With You Everywhere</strong></h4><p>Although you shouldn’t worry about your equipment, it is still a good habit to carry your camera with you everywhere. From the moment you wake up to the moment you go to sleep you are a daily vlogger, you never know when something will happen. Always be prepared. Your camera is to you, as a gun is to a soldier. It’s what sets you apart from all the civilians, so keep it close at hand.</p><h4 id="10-Don’t-Neglect-Your-Health"><a href="#10-Don’t-Neglect-Your-Health" class="headerlink" title="10. Don’t Neglect Your Health"></a><strong>10. Don’t Neglect Your Health</strong></h4><p>Earlier I compared daily vlogging to running a marathon, and like a marathon, there is a point where you need to be aware of yourself. You want to push yourself, but you don’t want to overdo it to a point where you damage your physical or mental health. Only you know when you have gone too far. If you feel like daily vlogging is ruining your life and the goal you set for yourself isn’t something you desire anymore, ask yourself: can I take a week off and decide if video creating is something I want to continue?</p><h4 id="11-Do-Watch-Other-Daily-Vloggers"><a href="#11-Do-Watch-Other-Daily-Vloggers" class="headerlink" title="11. Do Watch Other Daily Vloggers"></a><strong>11. Do Watch Other Daily Vloggers</strong></h4><p>By seeing how other YouTubers have done daily vlogs, you can get ideas, see what aspect of their videos you like or dislike, and learn from their presentation, content, and community engagement. By watching daily vloggers, you can also start interacting with their content as well. It is always easier to stay motivated when you have support. By watching and reaching out to the daily vloggers you enjoy, you can build a network of people who are going through the same journey as you.</p><h4 id="12-Don’t-Forget-About-Your-Audience"><a href="#12-Don’t-Forget-About-Your-Audience" class="headerlink" title="12. Don’t Forget About Your Audience"></a><strong>12. Don’t Forget About Your Audience</strong></h4><p>Remember that in the end, you are creating videos for someone else to enjoy. Even though you might be doing the daily vlog for yourself, if you want your viewers to return every day, you have to have an overall mission for your project. Is your message one that is aimed to motivate or do you want to document a journey? Don’t create your content in a vacuum, ask your viewers for feedback so you know how to improve.</p><p>Embarking on your daily vlogging adventure is not one to take lightly, but after 1 month, 1 season, or 1 year, you will be able to look back and see all that you have accomplished and feel proud. With the advice from this article, you can properly prepare yourself and enjoy each step of the process. Don’t overthink it, have fun!</p><p><em>Are you thinking of starting your daily vlog?

Many newbies to videography, though, don’t think about this when they use their camera indoors and discover that their recorded footage appears too dark.</p><p>If you want to use your camera indoors as many YouTubers do, you’ll need to have extra light. But the solution is not as simple as surrounding yourself with lamps that are all randomly placed.</p><p>Below, I’ll go into detail on how you can set up your lighting equipment to make your YouTube videos look good.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Table of Contents <a href="#USING-LIGHT-YOU-ALREADY-HAVE">Using Light You Already Have</a> <a href="#Window-Lighting">Window Lighting</a><a href="#Home-Lighting">Home Lighting</a> <a href="#HOME-STUDIO-LIGHTING">Home Studio Lighting</a> <a href="#Light-Control">Light Control</a><a href="#Three-Point-Lighting">3-Point Lighting</a><a href="#four-point-lighting">4-Point Lighting</a></th></tr></thead></table><h2 id="Part-1-Using-Light-You-Already-Have"><a href="#Part-1-Using-Light-You-Already-Have" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Using Light You Already Have"></a>Part 1: Using Light You Already Have</h2><p>Most beginner YouTubers light their videos with what they already have. That’s what I did to start as well. In the past, my video recording space consisted of natural sunlight coming from my window and ceiling light for times when the sunlight wasn’t strong enough.</p><h3 id="1-Window-Lighting"><a href="#1-Window-Lighting" class="headerlink" title="1.  Window Lighting"></a>1.  Window Lighting</h3><p>The best thing about window lighting is that it’s free. The worst thing about it is that it’s uncontrollable. The amount of light you get in your video can vary with all the changes in the weather.</p><p>Window lighting for me was especially difficult to work with because I live in a very rainy and cloudy city, Vancouver, Canada, where we pretty much just get three months of good sun.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/window-lighting-comparison.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Video Lighting"                ></p><p>Above are two freeze frames from one of Daniel’s past window-lit vlogs. Although these two frames are both from the same vlog, you can see that the image on the right looks brighter due to clearer skies at that moment. These varying amounts of light is what you will have to deal with if you choose to light your YouTube video with window lighting.</p><h3 id="2-Home-Lighting"><a href="#2-Home-Lighting" class="headerlink" title="2. Home Lighting"></a>2. Home Lighting</h3><p>Home lighting is another source of light that many new YouTubers use. In the past, when my window light wasn’t strong enough to light my video recording space, I would turn on the ceiling light.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/home-lighting-for-youtube-videos.jpg"                      alt="Mixed Lighting"                ></p><p>Notice how the color of Daniel’s skin looks much more orange here (above) than the color of the skin in the two side-by-side window lighting examples? The side of the face also appears to look bluer. This all happened because he mixed up different color temperatures shining out of the two lights (cooler window light and warmer ceiling light).</p><p>Most home lighting is warmer in its color temperature. If you want to use your home lights without everything being orange-tinted, you’ll need to switch out your light bulbs for daytime LED light bulbs.</p><p>Ceiling lights are also typically situated in the center of a room in order to light an entire room evenly. This is not likely to be the best location for your filming video. Since the ceiling light was directly above the face in the above example, you can see harder shadows beneath his cheeks.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Home-Studio-Lighting"><a href="#Part-2-Home-Studio-Lighting" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Home Studio Lighting"></a>Part 2: Home Studio Lighting</h2><p>If you rather not deal with all the window and home lighting challenges, you can set up studio lighting in your home.</p><h3 id="1-Light-Control"><a href="#1-Light-Control" class="headerlink" title="1. Light Control"></a>1. Light Control</h3><p>The first thing you’ll want to do to set up studio lighting in your home is to pick a room to film in and eliminate as much external lighting as you can. Use blinds, curtains, towels, or any thick fabric to block sunlight from shining into your room.</p><h3 id="2-3-Point-Lighting"><a href="#2-3-Point-Lighting" class="headerlink" title="2. 3-Point Lighting"></a>2. 3-Point Lighting</h3><p>The most common setup for studio lighting is 3-point lighting. For this kind of lighting you’ll need three lights: a key light, a fill light, and a back light (also called a hair light).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-lighting-3-point-lighting.jpg"                      alt="3-Point Lighting"                ></p><p>Out of the three lights, the key light should be the brightest. When it is positioned to the left of you (as shown in the diagram above) your right side will have shadows.</p><p>To minimize the shadows on your right side, use a weaker light as a fill light. You don’t want your fill light to completely eliminate all your shadows or else your shot will look flat.</p><p>Lastly, a backlight positioned behind you can give an appealing highlight to the ends of your head and even help to separate your hair from blending into your background if both happen to be dark.</p><h3 id="3-4-Point-Lighting"><a href="#3-4-Point-Lighting" class="headerlink" title="3. 4-Point Lighting"></a>3. 4-Point Lighting</h3><p>As a YouTuber, you may not only want yourself to be seen optimally with proper lighting, but you may also want your background to be seen optimally, especially if you’ve taken the time to decorate it for your audience.</p><p>What you’ll need to ensure that your background is sufficiently lit is 4-point lighting setup. The 4-point lighting setup is the same as a 3-point lighting setup, but with an additional light shining at your background.</p><p>For more information on lighting equipment, check out my <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/top-17-video-lighting-equipment-for-youtubers-440.html" >Top 17 Video Lighting Equipment For YouTubers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h3 id="Touch-Up-YouTube-Videos-with-Filmora"><a href="#Touch-Up-YouTube-Videos-with-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Touch Up YouTube Videos with Filmora"></a>Touch Up YouTube Videos with Filmora</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is one of the best video editing software for YouTube beginners to start the YouTube channel.
