In order to do so, you want to click on the File button and then go to Import. You will see a side menu on which you need to click Media and select the file that you want to upload. Keep in mind that you might have to wait for a short period of time while the videos are being uploaded.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/beginner-tips-for-vegas-pro-1.jpg"                      alt=" Importing Clips "                ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> You can also import videos which have been published on your channel by downloading them and saving them as MP4 files. On the other hand, if you have the intention of editing videos published on other channels, you might want to use <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/videoconverter/download/" >Wondershare Video Converter Ultimate <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in order to download and convert them to your Mac and get them imported on Sony Vegas.</p><h4 id="Step-2-Edit-the-video-and-audio-files-on-the-Timeline"><a href="#Step-2-Edit-the-video-and-audio-files-on-the-Timeline" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Edit the video and audio files on the Timeline"></a>Step 2: Edit the video and audio files on the Timeline</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/beginner-tips-for-vegas-pro-2.jpg"                      alt=" Timeline "                ></p><p>Sony Vegas introduces a Timeline with Video and Audio tracks. They contain the clips you’ve used in the entire editing process. You can edit them by aligning them as you see fit in order to come up with the best sequence. You can also add additional tracks. In order to do so, all you need to do is right click on the space which is empty and then go Add video track.</p><h4 id="Step-3-Add-special-effects"><a href="#Step-3-Add-special-effects" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Add special effects"></a>Step 3: Add special effects</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/beginner-tips-for-vegas-pro-3.jpg"                      alt=" Effects "                ></p><p>Of course, what’s video editing software without powerful special effect capabilities? You will see the special effects tab located on the left side of your screen. You can easily browse throughout all of them in order to get a sense of what you can achieve with your video. There are quite a lot of different special effects that you can incorporate in your YouTube video and make it perfect.</p><h4 id="Step-4-Export"><a href="#Step-4-Export" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: Export"></a>Step 4: Export</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/beginner-tips-for-vegas-pro-5.jpg"                      alt=" Color Match "                ></p><p>This is the thing that you need to do once you are done with the process to edit YouTube videos with Sony Vegas. It’s a very easy task to handle and if you’ve come that far you are already on the finish line. Go to File -&gt; Export and choose the specific extension that you want to use. The clip is going to be saved in the directory that you’ve selected, and it’s ready to watch and upload.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/n-2024-protecting-integrity-while-boosting-your-youtube-followers-count/"><u>[New] In 2024, Protecting Integrity While Boosting Your YouTube Followers Count</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/ove-in-action-top-9-premium-wedding-films-on-youtube-and-vimeo-for-2024/"><u>[New] Love in Action Top 9 Premium Wedding Films on YouTube and Vimeo for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/rganizing-your-youtube-content-with-ease/"><u>[New] Organizing Your YouTube Content with Ease</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-making-everyday-moments-memorable-on-youtube/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Making Everyday Moments Memorable on YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/ed-expert-tips-for-securing-top-tier-youtube-ad-campaigns-using-famebit-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Expert Tips for Securing Top-Tier YouTube Ad Campaigns Using FameBit for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/ed-how-big-should-a-good-thumbnail-be-youtubes-ultimate-guide-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] How Big Should a Good Thumbnail Be?

If you want to be found and to be able to monetize your YouTube channel, you’re going to need to find your niche.</p><p>If you’re serious about turning your YouTube hobby into a lucrative career, you’re going to need a niche that not only lets you do the things you’re passionate about but which also gets you the views you need. The perfect niche will be something that your audience is already looking for, not ridiculously competitive, and which still allows you to demonstrate your passion and knowledge.</p><p>It’s not easy finding a perfect niche on YouTube. You’re going to need some creativity, self-awareness, directed intention, and a good deal of thought, so be prepared to invest some time and energy into this process. If you don’t get it right the first time, take a moment to figure out where you went wrong and just try again. Or you can try some influencer marketing platform such as <a class="link"   href="https://www.influenex.com/" >InflueNex <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to help you find your niche. You’ll also be able to use the platform to learn more about the niche of your similar channels. Let’s take a look at how you can start looking for your ideal niche on YouTube.</p><hr><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Best-YouTube-Video-Editor-for-Beginners"><a href="#Best-YouTube-Video-Editor-for-Beginners" class="headerlink" title="Best YouTube Video Editor for Beginners"></a>Best YouTube Video Editor for Beginners</h2><p>Make your first YouTube video effortlessly with a versatile video editor Filmora.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                > </a></p><hr><p>Quick Jump Menu:</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">How to Find Your YouTube Niche [5 Tips]</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Best 14 Trending Niches on YouTube [High CPM Niches] </a></li></ul><h2 id="Is-There-an-Audience-for-This-Niche"><a href="#Is-There-an-Audience-for-This-Niche" class="headerlink" title="Is There an Audience for This Niche?"></a>Is There an Audience for This Niche?</h2><p>If you’re ready to start hunting down your niche, there are a few ways to go about it. You could start by listing your hobbies and looking for trends with those, or by thinking about what types of videos you like to make the most. How could what you do for a living inspire your channel or your knowledge of a particular topic?</p><p>The key is to discover where you can bring something unique or interesting to YouTube, hopefully by combining your passions, hobbies, and knowledge into one big ball of brilliance. For example, if you’re keen to do cooking tutorials but spent a year traveling Asia, why not do Asian-inspired cooking? Or if you have a passion for fashion but work as a recruitment consultant, why not offer content about dressing for work and interviews?</p><p>This sweet spot where your passion and talents meet with your video genre is where you’ll find your ultimate niche lurking.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1997695/19272" target="_top" id="1997695">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1997695" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1997695/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Why-Is-It-Important-to-Find-Your-Niche"><a href="#Why-Is-It-Important-to-Find-Your-Niche" class="headerlink" title="Why Is It Important to Find Your Niche?"></a>Why Is It Important to Find Your Niche?</h2><p>Finding a niche is all about giving your viewers what they want to see. Imagine you travel and upload vlogs about your travels every day. Almost all of your content is about travel, but then one day, randomly, you upload a video about cooking food. Your video was popular, you got more than 30k views, but only five people subscribed to your channel; why?</p><p>The answer is simple. If those who viewed the cooking video considered subscribing, they would have clicked onto your channel and seen that none of your other videos were about this topic. Despite uploading a good video, you seemed irrelevant to them, so they didn’t bother.</p><p>From the point of view of your subscribers, they want to know what you’re all about. They need to feel confident that, when they subscribe to you, they’ll be getting lots of quality content about the things they are most interested in. Having a clear and focused niche will allow you to do this for them.</p><h2 id="Narrowing-Down-Your-YouTube-Niche"><a href="#Narrowing-Down-Your-YouTube-Niche" class="headerlink" title="Narrowing Down Your YouTube Niche"></a>Narrowing Down Your YouTube Niche</h2><p>The smaller and more specific your focus, the easier you’ll find it to get and hold onto subscribers. For example, if you’re niche is about dog training, why not focus on even more about doing it about training pugs? If you’re doing a parenting vlog, make it more specific by doing a parenting vlog for mums of boys, or twins, or toddlers.</p><p>By narrowing down your focus, your audience will be much easier to market to and to appeal to. When someone from your target audience finds your channel, they’re going to think ‘wow, this is just what I’ve been looking for’, and they’ll watch, like, share and interact with your videos way more than someone who is just a little bit interested.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075462/7443" target="_top" id="2075462">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075462" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075462/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-Find-Your-Niche-5-Tips"><a href="#How-to-Find-Your-Niche-5-Tips" class="headerlink" title="How to Find Your Niche [5 Tips]"></a>How to Find Your Niche [5 Tips]</h2><p>If you’re still at a loss of how to identify the best niche for your YouTube channel, let us help. Here are some key things to think about when looking for your niche which will help you get where you need to be:</p><ul><li><strong>What are you good at? What are you passionate about?</strong></li></ul><p>Make a list of things you’re good at. Don’t be modest now, this isn’t the time. Think about what other people would ask for your help with, and what you’re most confident with. Getting to grips with what you have a talent for is a great place to start.</p><p>An example of this is PONY Syndrome, a makeup artist renowned for her Taylor Swift transformation. She found that people would often come to her for makeup advice, so she started making videos of her techniques. Fast forward a couple of years and she’s got four million subscribers and a profitable YouTube channel.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/pony-effect.jpg"                                     ></p><p>You might not think you’re an ‘expert’ in an area, but often it’s the interesting combination of your talents and passions that makes you unique. Coach Tulin is a wonderful lady who is of a plus size but who is also passionate about fitness. She’s made a popular channel that demonstrates how to modify popular exercises to make them accessible for plus-size people, as well as showing just how to fit plus-size people can be! Her fan base is smaller, at 89k subscribers, but she’s still a big influencer in her field.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/coach-tulin.jpg"                                     ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148775/18498" target="_top" id="2148775">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2148775" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148775/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Subscribers who get help from you are more likely to come back to you time and again. Although we all have a good laugh watching cat videos and other entertaining clips, the YouTube channels that tend to make the most money are those which genuinely help people.</p><ul><li><strong>Is there an audience for your potential niche?</strong></li></ul><p>Once you’ve got an idea about your potential niche, you’ll need to make sure there are actually people out there who want to watch it. To test this out, think about a video you could make for your niche and try looking it up on YouTube. If there are a ton of results, your niche is probably not focused enough. If there are zero results, probably nobody is looking for that type of video.</p><p>You’re looking for somewhere in between the two extremes. If a couple of well-established channels have made a video or two on your topic, but haven’t really focused on it, you can be confident that there is an audience out there but not too much competition. You could also look for something that there are a lot of blog posts or websites about and be the first to migrate the content to YouTube.</p><p>For example, if you were to search ‘makeup tutorial’, you’ll find around 23 million results. Most of these are from established influencers who have already pretty much cornered the market, so getting a foot in the door as a new YouTuber here is going to be tough. That’s not to say you shouldn’t do it, but you’ll have to work hard to make your channel stand out. Be original, put your own spin on the genre and you’ll get there eventually.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-niche-1.jpg"                                     ></p><p>If you were to start drilling down into that niche, you’ll start to see where the opportunities exist. For example, if you narrow down your makeup search for ‘makeup tutorial for Asian male’, the results are in the region of 496k videos, a good deal less than the high-level outcome. If this was your passion, your talent and you could make great videos about it, you stand a good chance of breaking into this niche relatively easily.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-niche-2.jpg"                                     ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://dhgate.sjv.io/c/5597632/2106655/12108" target="_top" id="2106655">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/12108-2106655" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://dhgate.sjv.io/i/5597632/2106655/12108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><ul><li><strong>What will you do differently to other channels?</strong></li></ul><p>With so much content out there to view, you’re not going to make your millions on YouTube if you’re boring. Viewers know that fun, quality content is out there, and will seek to find someone better than you if you’re too ‘run of the mill’ for their taste. People come to YouTube for information, but stick around for personality, so inject some of yours into everything you do.</p><p>There are loads of ways you can bring excitement and engagement to your YouTube channel. Think about the way you look, the way you talk, how your introduction is made, the effects used in your video, the overall concept, the direction of the camera work… the possibilities for making unique and exciting videos are pretty much limitless, but you’ll need to get creative if you want to stand out from the crowd.</p><ul><li><strong>Can you make money in this niche?</strong></li></ul><p>The majority of people start YouTube channels with big dreams of making millions from their work. However, if you’re in the wrong niche to start with, you could fall flat on your face before you even start. Researching whether it’s possible to monetize your YouTube niche is crucial; here’s how to find out:</p><ol><li>Will a company be likely to sponsor you to use their products?</li><li>Can you create a ‘side business’ alongside your channel?</li></ol><p>Sponsorship can be super lucrative, but very difficult to secure. Is there a company out there that has products you could use in your videos? If so, do they already have preferred YouTubers that they sponsor? As for a side business, you could look to doing anything from offering one-to-one consultancy to selling products via Amazon on an affiliate deal. The important thing is that you need to have a plan from the start.</p><p>Check out the most profitable niches for monetizing your YouTube channel below.</p><ul><li><strong>Can you generate enough content in this niche?</strong></li></ul><p>How many topics can you think of to make videos about for your channel? If you can’t think of at least 10 off the top of your head, that’s not a good sign. You’re going to need lots of ideas and inspiration for your YouTube videos, and if you’re already struggling to think of things to do, imagine how much you’ll be struggling two, three or four years down the line.</p><p>You need to absolutely love and be inspired by your niche because chances are you’ll be making videos on this topic for many years to come. Are you completely sure that you’ll be as enthusiastic about this topic next year? Will your passion for the content stand the test of time? Try to project how your life will change over the coming years and whether your niche will be suited to you as time goes on.</p><h2 id="Best-14-Trending-Niches-on-YouTube-High-CPM-Niches"><a href="#Best-14-Trending-Niches-on-YouTube-High-CPM-Niches" class="headerlink" title="Best 14 Trending Niches on YouTube [High CPM Niches]"></a>Best 14 Trending Niches on YouTube [High CPM Niches]</h2><p>There are some YouTube niches that are easier to monetize than others. That’s not to say you should restrict yourself to only these niches, but if you’re stuck for inspiration, you’ll find these focused areas are a good place to start your search.</p><p><strong>#1 Makeup</strong></p><p>By far and away one of the most popular YouTube niches, makeup can be a great place to start. Although you’ll find lots of competition here, there is a massive audience too.</p><p><strong>#2 Gaming</strong></p><p>Gaming YouTubers are probably the most well-known; who hasn’t heard of PewDiePie? And they’re making money doing the thing they love most: gaming. It’s tough to stand out in this crowded niche, but if you can be fresh and different, you could start building your own fan base.</p><p><strong>#3 Food</strong></p><p>If you love to cook (or even just to eat!) food channels can be fab. Showing off recipes is a tried and tested moneymaker, as is showing how to use gadgets and tools in the kitchen.</p><p><strong>#4 Tech review</strong></p><p>We’re all using technology at home, at work, and in our pockets, and want to know that we’re buying the right stuff and using it the right way. People are hungry for this type of content, whether it’s apps and software or physical hardware.</p><p><strong>#5 Travel</strong></p><p>Travel channels have some of the sexiest content on the web, and people love to see what the world is like out there. Invest in a good action camera and find an angle to the places your visit, such as the best places to eat, hidden gems, etc.</p><p><strong>#6 Fashion</strong></p><p>Fashion can be great for YouTube, from reviewing clothing items to keeping your audience updated on the latest trends. It’s a great niche for getting sponsors and earning from affiliate marketing too.</p><p><strong>#7 Sports</strong></p><p>You’ll never run out of content if you’re busy keeping people up to date with their favorite sports teams. Just be careful not to show copyrighted material as you could find your hard work being taken down.</p><p><strong>#8 Animals</strong></p><p>It was cat video’s that birthed the notion of a viral video, and even today hilarious animal clips can garner a huge audience. As well as animals doing funny things, you could also make videos about animal care, training, and reviews of pet products.</p><p><strong>#9 Photography</strong></p><p>Thousands of budding photographers look to YouTube for good advice on how to take better shots. Photography channels can also review equipment and can benefit from affiliate links for these.</p><p><strong>#10 Movies</strong></p><p>If you’re a movie buff, why not take your opinions of the big screen to the small (and often tiny) screen? Post reviews, do top tens, or even create parodies of movies yourself. Just watch out for that copyright issue again.</p><p><strong>#11 How-to tutorials</strong></p><p>Everyone needs to know something in their life, whether it’s how to tie their shoelaces or how to change a spark plug on a car. Answering these ‘how to…’ questions could get you ranking highly and gathering millions of views.</p><p><strong># 12 Music</strong></p><p>You have to be careful when doing a music channel, as you’re unlikely to get permission to play actual tracks. However, you could do commentaries on music news, give advice on instrument care or even teach people how to play. If you’re a musician yourself, this is a great way to get more exposure for your band.</p><p><strong>#13 ASMR</strong></p><p>One of the fastest-growing niches on YouTube, ASMR, or Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response to give it its full name, is all about the experience. Using soothing sounds and imagery to relax viewers, ASMR YouTubers look to create a physical response in the viewer to something happening in the video.</p><p><strong>#14 Lifestyle</strong></p><p>Lifestyle vloggers are those who don’t really fit into a particular niche. They tend to be highly immersed in the YouTube community, disclosing personal information about themselves and sharing their interests with their audience.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-access.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-master-your-images-top-10-pixlr-hacks-revealed/"><u>[New] In 2024, Master Your Images Top 10 Pixlr Hacks Revealed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/ourney-to-discovering-your-personal-youtube-musical-realm-for-2024/"><u>[New] Journey to Discovering Your Personal Youtube Musical Realm for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/humbnail-wizardry-top-8-tools-to-boost-view-counts/"><u>[New] Thumbnail Wizardry Top 8 Tools to Boost View Counts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-essential-history-vids-student-edition-of-top-10-lists/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Essential History Vids Student Edition of Top 10 Lists</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-in-depth-look-at-iphones-top-watermarking-software-choices/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved In-Depth Look at iPhone's Top Watermarking Software Choices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/ed-mastering-awesome-valorant-thumbnails-for-youtube-content/"><u>[Updated] Mastering Awesome Valorant Thumbnails for YouTube Content</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/ed-mastering-the-art-of-discovering-elusive-youtube-videos-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Mastering the Art of Discovering Elusive YouTube Videos for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/ed-sculpting-waterway-content-with-flair-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Sculpting Waterway Content with Flair for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-unleash-your-potential-navigating-the-world-of-switch-pro-in-steam-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Unleash Your Potential Navigating the World of Switch Pro in Steam for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/approved-aspect-ratios-unveiled-a-complete-youtube-manual/"><u>2024 Approved Aspect Ratios Unveiled A Complete YOUTUBE Manual</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/2024-approved-unleashing-humor-the-kapwing-meme-builder-way/"><u>2024 Approved Unleashing Humor The Kapwing Meme Builder Way</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/dacast-review-and-alternatives/"><u>DaCast Review and Alternatives</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/how-to-hidefake-snapchat-location-on-your-xiaomi-redmi-note-12-proplus-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to Hide/Fake Snapchat Location on Your Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro+ 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/in-2024-unlock-your-creative-potential-with-windows-11-movie-maker/"><u>In 2024, Unlock Your Creative Potential with Windows 11 Movie Maker</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/ltimate-guide-to-digital-green-magic-comprecipate-free-lessons-from-4-masterful-channels-for-2024/"><u>The Ultimate Guide to Digital Green Magic Comprecipate Free Lessons From 4 Masterful Channels for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/things-you-should-know-when-unlocking-total-wireless-of-apple-iphone-14-by-drfone-ios/"><u>Things You Should Know When Unlocking Total Wireless Of Apple iPhone 14</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/transforming-personal-narratives-best-practices-for-video-praise/"><u>Transforming Personal Narratives Best Practices for Video Praise</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Teachers can now collaborate, connect and innovate with a multitude of students in ways that were never imagined before by employing the power of YouTube.</p><p><strong>Enhances the comprehension of complex topics</strong></p><p> Certain subjects are technical in nature and teachers usually have a hard time explaining them to the students. By using YouTube in the classroom, teachers are an a better position to offer clear and easy to understand illustrations which will in turn demystify the tough concepts and make it easy for students to understand and comprehend complex topics.</p><p><strong>Creates more engagement from students</strong></p><p> Learning primarily comprises of audio and visual components. Unlike traditional modes of teaching where the teacher offered explanation and the students are expected to take notes, videos are more engaging and has the power to make students stay more alert, thus increase their chances of absorbing the lesions and getting most from the subjects.</p><p><strong>Ideal for slow learners</strong></p><p> When using YouTube in the classroom, the teacher has full control on the pace of learning and this is ideal for taking of both the fast and slow learners. In case a student finds a concept being explained too fast, they can simply request the part to be replayed or it can be slowed down to play at a pace that will be easy for them to grasp.</p><p><strong>One teacher, multiple classrooms</strong></p><p> The other benefit of using YouTube in the classroom is that after a teacher prepares his learning videos, they get the flexibility using the video in more than just one classroom. It also makes it easy for them when they are away and they need to attend classes. All they have to do is to use the prerecorded video lesions so that they don’t entirely miss out on classes.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148637/16836" target="_top" id="2148637">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148637" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="125" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148637/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Tips-for-Using-YouTube-in-Classroom"><a href="#Tips-for-Using-YouTube-in-Classroom" class="headerlink" title="Tips for Using YouTube in Classroom"></a>Tips for Using YouTube in Classroom</h2><p> For teachers and tutors, there are various ways of using YouTube in the classroom.

This has gradually evolved over the years and these days the user interface of Vimeo is more attractive than YouTube. Vimeo would give the user fewer adverts, offer easy navigation and of course, allow them to watch the videos on a large video player. Though these days YouTube is also offering a ‘theatre mode’ for the full-screen view along with a skip adoption, yet the quality of its user experience is still isn’t at par with Vimeo. YouTube is still trying its best to satisfy its one billion&#x2F;month users but still, Vimeo is the winner when it comes to unparalleled user experience.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2043661/7443" target="_top" id="2043661">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2043661" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2043661/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Tips-for-Editing-Videos-on-YouTube-DailyMotion-and-Vimeo"><a href="#Tips-for-Editing-Videos-on-YouTube-DailyMotion-and-Vimeo" class="headerlink" title="Tips for Editing Videos on YouTube, DailyMotion, and Vimeo"></a>Tips for Editing Videos on YouTube, DailyMotion, and Vimeo</h2><p>Before uploading your video on any one of these above-mentioned platforms the first thing you have to do is get your videos edited.

Interpreting YouTube Watch Time Reports"></a>1. Interpreting YouTube Watch Time Reports</h3><p>To find <strong>Watch time reports</strong> you just need to log into your Google account, go to the <strong>Creator studio</strong>, click the analytics tab, and then click on <strong>watch time</strong>. You can see the watch time of every video on your channel, which is important data to have because watch time is the most important factor when it comes to ranking your video in search results.</p><p>A watch time report includes the total amount of time that your video, or a selection of videos, is actually being watched for. In order to make sure that you are publishing only quality videos you need to make sure that your viewers are consistently sticking to your videos and watching them all away through, or at least to the half-way mark. Watch time represents one of the most meaningful metrics in ensuring that you are engaging your audience.</p><p>YouTube analytics can now display a watch time of every video that you have produced. Seeing the metrics on how long people are actually watching every video that you produce can show you what you’ve done right in the past and what you need to do more of to continue raising your watch time.</p><p>Alongside watch time you can see the average duration individual viewers are watching your videos for. The average percentage of your video that gets viewed will showcase areas where you may be struggling with your video content. For example, if an abnormally high number of viewers are clicking away during your intro, there’s probably something about that clip that needs to be changed.</p><p>In the watch time reports for individual videos, you will be able to see data on where your views are coming from and which demographics are watching the most. Where your viewers are watching, in terms of desktop or mobile, is also interesting data that is available in this section.</p><p>Click here for more tips on<a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/12-proven-ways-to-increase-youtube-views-315.html" >increasing your views <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://homestyler.sjv.io/c/5597632/1943647/22993" target="_top" id="1943647">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1943647" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://homestyler.sjv.io/i/5597632/1943647/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-Interpreting-YouTube-Interaction-Reports"><a href="#2-Interpreting-YouTube-Interaction-Reports" class="headerlink" title="2. Interpreting YouTube Interaction Reports"></a>2. Interpreting YouTube Interaction Reports</h3><p>Interaction reports are related to the actions viewers take – i.e. subscribing to your channel, liking your videos, or leaving a comments. You can find interaction reports in the <strong>Creator Studio</strong> under <strong>Analytics</strong>.</p><p>Interaction reports can be broken down into several different reports that can help determine the overall performance of any YouTube videos. The main interaction reports that you should be interested in include:</p><p><strong>1. Subscribers:</strong> You can find extensive data on your subscribers, like demographics including age groups and gender. Learning more about your subscribers can help you to tailor your content. For example, if you learn that your viewers are mostly young women under 24 in the USA, you can do research into what is currently popular with young women under 24 in the USA.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Want to see your subscriber count in real-time? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>2. Likes and dislikes:</strong> Likes and dislikes aren’t a powerful metric when it comes to search engine rankings, but they provide useful information to creators. If you’re getting a lot of dislikes on a video, you should look into why. If you’re getting a lot of likes on a video, it can indicate that you should focus on creating similar content.</p><p><strong>3. Playlists:</strong> A viewer watching a video in a playlist is much more likely to keep watching more videos from that playlist, making playlists great for the growth of your channel. Reports in this section will help you figure out which of your playlists is performing best, which could give you an idea of which types of videos or video topics are going over best with your viewers.</p><p><strong>4. Comments:</strong> Reading comments is a great way to figure out what your viewers think, but that’s not all they’re good for. If viewers return to a video to continue talking to you or other viewers then that will drive up your views and watch time. If a video is especially good at generating discussion, you should figure out why (i.e. your sign-off question) and keep doing it.</p><p><strong>5. Sharing:</strong> Discovering where your video is being shared can be important for figuring out what platforms you should be on besides YouTube. If your video is shared and viewed a lot on Twitter, you should consider making a Twitter account for your channel.</p><p><strong>6. Cards:</strong> Tracking the performance of your Cards will help you optimize them to direct traffic between your videos. By testing out different time stamps for cards you’ll find the perfect places to put them. By trying different messages in your cards you’ll learn how to write ‘calls to action’ that mobilize your viewers.</p><p><strong>End screens:</strong> End Screens are essential for keeping viewers on your channel. The report of the click-through rates of your end screens is important for helping you figure out which kinds of links work, and which style of ends screen is most effective for you. Are people more likely to click when you talk to them through the end screen, or when it’s a static card?</p><p><strong>7. 360 heat map reports:</strong> A heat map report works specifically with 360° videos if you are choosing to engage your audience with this type of content. Viewing YouTube video statistics for 360° heat maps will help to show the areas on your video that viewers are most interested in.</p><h2 id="How-to-View-Other-Peoples-YouTube-Statistics"><a href="#How-to-View-Other-Peoples-YouTube-Statistics" class="headerlink" title="How to View Other Peoples YouTube Statistics"></a>How to View Other Peoples YouTube Statistics</h2><p>If you want to check out the statistics of rival YouTube channels (<a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/youtube-subscriber-chart---the-5-most-subscribed-youtube-channels-320.html" >including the most subscribed channels on YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>), or channels you’re a fan of, try using <a class="link"   href="http://www.socialblade.com/" >Social Blade <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

As long as you have some reliable subscribers leaving comments on your videos you should be able to schedule a live stream and know it will have an audience. People feel a personal connection with their favorite vloggers so if you give your subscribers a chance to interact with you in real time they will probably plan to join in. The key to a good live streaming is to respond to comments and questions from people who are watching. Besides watching the live chat of your video you can create a hashtag for your stream and monitor it on twitter.</p><p><strong>Table of Contents</strong></p><ul><li><a href="#part1"><strong>Why Livestream?</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part2"><strong>Type of Content to Livestream</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part3"><strong>What You Need to Livestream On YouTube</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part4"><strong>4 Ways to Setup Your Livestream On YouTube</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part5"><strong>8 Tips to Improve Your Livestream on YouTube</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part6"><strong>How to Grow As A Livestreamer on YouTube</strong></a></li></ul><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Why-Livestream"><a href="#Why-Livestream" class="headerlink" title="Why Livestream?"></a>Why Livestream?</h2><p>You have grown your audience, and now you want to take your channel to the next level and diversify your content.</p><p>Whether you are vlogging, gaming, or running tutorials on YouTube, there is potential to host a live broadcast. It’s not limited to any genre, you simply need to create content that people are interested in watching.</p><p>Before we get started into the How, let’s start with a few reasons Why you should be live streaming your content.</p><h4 id="Connect-and-engage-with-your-audience"><a href="#Connect-and-engage-with-your-audience" class="headerlink" title="Connect and engage with your audience"></a>Connect and engage with your audience</h4><p>When a viewer leaves a comment during a livestream you will be able to see it right away and respond. Having an instantaneous conversation with a viewer while they are watching your video will encourage more engagement and establish a ber relationship with your viewers — and you will know that these viewers are not bots.</p><h4 id="Increase-watch-time-and-session-watch-time-on-your-channel"><a href="#Increase-watch-time-and-session-watch-time-on-your-channel" class="headerlink" title="Increase watch time and session watch time on your channel"></a>Increase watch time and session watch time on your channel</h4><p>If you are making YouTube videos on average 10 minutes long, and the viewer only watches half of it, that’s only 5 minutes of watch time, which is fine… But if you are live streaming for 45 minutes, and you are able to hold the viewer’s attention, you can surpass what your regular videos can do.</p><h4 id="Make-videos-faster"><a href="#Make-videos-faster" class="headerlink" title="Make videos faster"></a>Make videos faster</h4><p>As a YouTuber, you are always striving to be more efficient. Live streaming allows you to do that as you can set up and go. The content you end up creating during the duration of your livestream can then also be condensed into a highlight reel or a recap.</p><p>With a bit of planning before you go live, you can create a week’s worth of content in one go, instead of having multiple schedules for livestream content and your standard publishing videos.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144273/7443" target="_top" id="2144273">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144273" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144273/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Type-of-Content-to-Livestream"><a href="#Type-of-Content-to-Livestream" class="headerlink" title="Type of Content to Livestream"></a>Type of Content to Livestream</h2><p>Live streaming has a lot of value, but what type of content should you be streaming?</p><p>Here are a few popular ideas for content that will attract viewers to your livestream:</p><h4 id="Q-A-session"><a href="#Q-A-session" class="headerlink" title="Q&amp;A session"></a><strong>Q&amp;A session</strong></h4><h4 id="Unboxing"><a href="#Unboxing" class="headerlink" title="Unboxing"></a><strong>Unboxing</strong></h4><h4 id="Game-or-challenge"><a href="#Game-or-challenge" class="headerlink" title="Game or challenge"></a><strong>Game or challenge</strong></h4><h4 id="Sneak-preview-or-review"><a href="#Sneak-preview-or-review" class="headerlink" title="Sneak preview or review"></a><strong>Sneak preview or review</strong></h4><h4 id="Live-events-just-make-sure-the-Internet-can-support-it"><a href="#Live-events-just-make-sure-the-Internet-can-support-it" class="headerlink" title="Live events (just make sure the Internet can support it)"></a><strong>Live events</strong> (just make sure the Internet can support it)</h4><h4 id="A-demo-or-a-tutorial"><a href="#A-demo-or-a-tutorial" class="headerlink" title="A demo or a tutorial"></a><strong>A demo or a tutorial</strong></h4><h4 id="A-live-commentary-or-if-you-are-a-gamer-Let’s-Play-video"><a href="#A-live-commentary-or-if-you-are-a-gamer-Let’s-Play-video" class="headerlink" title="A live commentary or (if you are a gamer) Let’s Play video"></a><strong>A live commentary or (if you are a gamer) Let’s Play video</strong></h4><h2 id="What-You-Need-to-Livestream-On-YouTube"><a href="#What-You-Need-to-Livestream-On-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="What You Need to Livestream On YouTube"></a>What You Need to Livestream On YouTube</h2><h4 id="A-Plan-or-Outline"><a href="#A-Plan-or-Outline" class="headerlink" title="A Plan or Outline"></a>A Plan or Outline</h4><p>It’s good to know what your livestream is going to be about before you start. Is there a key message you want to hit, an action you want your viewers to take, or a structure you want to follow.</p><p>Just because it’s live, doesn’t mean it all has to be improvised. If you go in without a plan, you might end up feeling flustered or getting stressed out. Allow for spontaneous comments or events to take you off your initial plan, but always return to your outline so you know how to wrap up your livestream when you have to.</p><h4 id="Stable-Internet-Connection"><a href="#Stable-Internet-Connection" class="headerlink" title="Stable Internet Connection"></a>Stable Internet Connection</h4><p>You cannot conduct a quality livestream, if your Internet is bad. When evaluating your internet connection for live streaming on YouTube, look at the Upload speed. Depending on the quality of your video, these are the minimum upload speed rates your Internet will need to perform:</p><p>480p &#x3D; 1.5 mbps</p><p>720p &#x3D; 3 mbps</p><p>1080 &#x3D; 5 mbps</p><p>In addition, be aware of external causes that may be slowing down your internet such as someone else using it, a poorly performing router, or a damaged cable.</p><h4 id="Camera"><a href="#Camera" class="headerlink" title="Camera"></a>Camera</h4><p>If you have a smartphone or a laptop with a webcam built in, that is the best camera for you to get started live streaming. It’s good to have a milestone and work towards a more advanced camera, but until then, don’t feel discouraged because you don’t have expensive gear. If you have a smartphone, a laptop, or a basic webcam, that’s perfectly fine.</p><h4 id="Microphone"><a href="#Microphone" class="headerlink" title="Microphone"></a>Microphone</h4><p>You don’t need a great microphone for live streaming, you only need a good one. If you do want to spend several hundred to a thousand dollars for a professional studio microphone, nobody will stop you, but know this, a mic that is easy to use is as important as the audio quality as you develop a consistent live streaming schedule.</p><h4 id="Streaming-Software-For-Higher-Quality-Streams"><a href="#Streaming-Software-For-Higher-Quality-Streams" class="headerlink" title="Streaming Software (For Higher Quality Streams)"></a>Streaming Software (For Higher Quality Streams)</h4><p>Once upon a time, to livestream on YouTube, you needed additional software to capture content from desktop, camera, microphone, etc, called encoding software — but not anymore.</p><p>Those encoding software, such as <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >OBS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wirecast <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >VMix <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, are required if you are producing content that requires a high frame rate such as gaming, but not mandatory if you are simply vlogging or running a tutorial.</p><p>If you are using Chrome, you can<a class="link"   href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/20/youtube-rolls-out-a-new-feature-that-lets-you-go-live-from-the-desktop-without-an-encoder/" >stream live on YouTube without using an encoder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h4 id="A-Capture-Card-For-Higher-Quality-Streams"><a href="#A-Capture-Card-For-Higher-Quality-Streams" class="headerlink" title="A Capture Card (For Higher Quality Streams)"></a>A Capture Card (For Higher Quality Streams)</h4><p>You will need a capture card when you are capturing footage from a different PC or console. If you are a gamer and you are using one PC to stream and one PC to play your game, then you should consider getting a capture card.</p><h2 id="4-Ways-to-Setup-Your-Livestream-On-YouTube"><a href="#4-Ways-to-Setup-Your-Livestream-On-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="4 Ways to Setup Your Livestream On YouTube"></a>4 Ways to Setup Your Livestream On YouTube</h2><p>There are 4 main ways you can start live streaming on YouTube. The one that works best for you depends on the content you are going to be streaming.</p><h4 id="1-Camera-Go-Live-Chrome-Browser"><a href="#1-Camera-Go-Live-Chrome-Browser" class="headerlink" title="1. Camera&#x2F;Go Live (Chrome Browser)"></a>1. Camera&#x2F;Go Live (Chrome Browser)</h4><p>By accessing <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/webcam" >www.youtube.com/webcam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on the Google Chrome browser, you can start streaming immediately through your connected webcam. This way is best for a simple Q&amp;A or letting your viewers know your thoughts in a timely situation. This method does not require an encoder.</p><p> There are 3 ways to access livestream this way:</p><p>1. Click <a href="https://www.youtube.com/webcam"><strong>here</strong></a> to connect to your YouTube channel</p><p>2. You can access it from the top menu on YouTube</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/access-livestream1.jpg"                      alt="access livestream"                ></p><p>3. You can access it by clicking Camera under the Live Streaming tab in your Creator Studio</p><h4 id="2-Google-Hangouts-On-Air-Quick"><a href="#2-Google-Hangouts-On-Air-Quick" class="headerlink" title="2. Google Hangouts On Air (Quick)"></a><strong>2. Google Hangouts On Air (Quick)</strong></h4><p>Another way to livestream without an encoding software is by using the Google Hangouts On Air feature.</p><p>This is great if you want the feel of your livestream to be similar to a board meeting, where you can invite people, split screen, and share screen to illustrate your point.</p><p>Here’s how you can access this Google Hangouts On Air:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to Events under the Live Streaming tab in your Creator Studio</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click New Live Event button on the top right corner</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/new-live-event-button2.jpg"                      alt="new live event button"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Enter the event’s Info and Setting page.

Mobile"></a><strong>3. Mobile</strong></h4><p>Live streaming via your mobile device gives you a lot more freedom to maneuver. You can walk around and give your viewers a tour — but remember to stay within the WiFi or LTE range. That means you still won’t be able to livestream well inside an elevator.</p><p>Here’s how you can livestream on mobile:</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Access the YouTube app and make sure you are signed in to the account you want to livestream from.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: At the top, click on the camera icon</p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Click on Go Live</p><p>  <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> When live streaming, always hold your smartphone horizontally. This allows your video to be oriented as a landscape, instead of a portrait.</p><h4 id="4-Custom-Encoder"><a href="#4-Custom-Encoder" class="headerlink" title="4. Custom Encoder"></a><strong>4. Custom Encoder</strong></h4><p>The fourth way of live streaming on YouTube is with encoding software. This is the recommended method if video quality is essential, such as gaming videos.</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download and install an encoding software. In this example, we’ll be using <a class="link"   href="https://obsproject.com/" >OBS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Open OBS</p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Go to YouTube Creator Studio and enter the Stream Now page</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-creator-studio4.jpg"                      alt="youtube creator studio"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1982461">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982461.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1982461">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982461.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1982461%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1982461/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Under Encoder Setup, copy Stream name&#x2F;key (Warning: DO NOT share this key with anyone)</p><p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Return to OBS and enter the Setting menu on the lower right-hand side of the application</p><p><strong>Step 6</strong>: Click into the Stream tab</p><p>a) Under Stream Type, select Streaming Services</p><p>b) Under Service, select YouTube&#x2F;YouTube Gaming</p><p>c) Under Server, select Primary YouTube ingest server</p><p>d) In Stream Key box, paste the Stream Key you copied from YouTube</p><p>e) Click Apply and then OK</p><p><strong>Step 7</strong>: Plug in your webcam</p><p><strong>Step 8</strong>: In the main OBS dashboard, under the Sources menu, click the + icon and add Video Capture Device.

Check out from <a href="http://www.speedtest.net/"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p><h4 id="Have-Good-Lighting"><a href="#Have-Good-Lighting" class="headerlink" title="Have Good Lighting"></a>Have Good Lighting</h4><p>Be aware of your surroundings when you are about to livestream. You don’t need the top-notch lighting kit, you can simply sit beside a window and allow natural lights to illuminate your stream.</p><h4 id="Shoot-A-Live-Test-Unlisted"><a href="#Shoot-A-Live-Test-Unlisted" class="headerlink" title="Shoot A Live Test (Unlisted)"></a>Shoot A Live Test (Unlisted)</h4><p>Have a technical rehearsal by doing a livestream test, then rewatching it, and evaluating the quality of the audio and visual.</p><p>You don’t have to worry about your audience logging in and seeing your test if you set the Privacy of the stream to Unlisted.</p><h4 id="Look-at-the-Lens-Not-the-Screen"><a href="#Look-at-the-Lens-Not-the-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Look at the Lens, Not the Screen"></a>Look at the Lens, Not the Screen</h4><p>If you are streaming with the selfie camera on your smartphone or using your camera’s viewfinder to make sure you are in the frame, remember that you need to be looking at the lens — not the image of yourself.</p><p>Eye contact is important in building trust, and if you are looking at yourself, it will appear as if you are looking past your viewers instead of at them.</p><h4 id="Show-It-To-Your-Viewers"><a href="#Show-It-To-Your-Viewers" class="headerlink" title="Show It To Your Viewers"></a>Show It To Your Viewers</h4><p>Whatever you are talking about, if you can, show it to your viewers. YouTube is a visual medium, and that means your viewers can become disinterested if there’s nothing visual holding their attention.</p><p>In the beginning, you probably won’t have a multi-camera setup, so you cannot cut away from your livestream. However, you can share the screen and you can bring physical objects into a frame.</p><p>If you are talking about your dog, show her on camera. If you’re presenting something with a lot of steps, create a Powerpoint slideshow.</p><p>Consider what visuals or props you can add to your livestream to enhance your performance.</p><h4 id="Find-A-Way-to-Make-it-Evergreen"><a href="#Find-A-Way-to-Make-it-Evergreen" class="headerlink" title="Find A Way to Make it Evergreen"></a>Find A Way to Make it Evergreen</h4><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2012/10/16/guide-to-evergreen-content-marketing" >Evergreen content <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>refers to content that is relevant for a great length of time. Talking about an event isn’t evergreen, because the event will soon pass and become old news. However, giving some tips for how to plan an event would be evergreen content.</p><p>Since your livestream will be saved on YouTube and your viewers can replay and watch it. They’re more likely to enjoy it if the content is relevant and interesting.</p><h4 id="It-Doesn’t-Have-to-Be-Long"><a href="#It-Doesn’t-Have-to-Be-Long" class="headerlink" title="It Doesn’t Have to Be Long"></a>It Doesn’t Have to Be Long</h4><p>A livestream doesn’t need to be 40 minutes long. It only needs to be long enough for you to get your story across — and if you want to answer some questions and engage with your audience. As soon as your story is over, even if it’s only 5 minutes, that’s okay. Don’t stress about the length of your stream, it’s not an endurance competition.</p><h4 id="Allow-Yourself-to-Make-Mistakes"><a href="#Allow-Yourself-to-Make-Mistakes" class="headerlink" title="Allow Yourself to Make Mistakes"></a>Allow Yourself to Make Mistakes</h4><p>Another thing you shouldn’t worry about at all is making mistakes. When you are doing livestreams pretend you are engaging with someone in real life. In real life, you aren’t able to edit out your mistakes, whether it’s a word mispronounced or coffee spilling. Roll with it and laugh it off.</p><h2 id="How-to-Grow-As-A-Livestreamer-on-YouTube"><a href="#How-to-Grow-As-A-Livestreamer-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="How to Grow As A Livestreamer on YouTube"></a>How to Grow As A Livestreamer on YouTube</h2><h4 id="Let-People-Know-When-You-Are-Streaming"><a href="#Let-People-Know-When-You-Are-Streaming" class="headerlink" title="Let People Know When You Are Streaming"></a>Let People Know When You Are Streaming</h4><p>Give people enough time to schedule it in, don’t spring it on them in the last minute.

Something that may have been surprising was the amount of equipment it takes to run a successful vlog. Besides your camera you need equipment for stabilizing it, for lighting your shots, and for recording better audio than your camera is capable of. If you still don’t know which camera to use, this article will tell you the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >best cameras for YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Do not be overwhelmed! There are loads of affordable options for YouTube equipment. There are even some tricks you can use to get by without some pieces of equipment until you are ready to make the investment.</p><p>Here are examples of some of the best YouTube equipment. Watch for the ‘Free Option!’ at the bottom of every section!</p><h4 id="1-Stabilizers-for-YouTube"><a href="#1-Stabilizers-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="1. Stabilizers for YouTube"></a>1. Stabilizers for YouTube</h4><p><strong>Selfie Stick:</strong> A lot of vloggers like to record from their phones, and selfie sticks make great stabilizers. You can put one end on the ground and use your selfie stick similarly to a monopod. Selfie sticks are also very affordable. The Cazbe Selfie Stick is only about $40. If you want to be a bit more sophisticated about your smartphone video then you might consider the KumbaCam 3 Axis Smart Phone Stabilizer, which is described as a ‘selfie stick on steroids’. It is a pricier option at $350.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-equipment01.jpg"                      alt="youtube equipment"                ></p><p><strong>Tripod:</strong> A tripod is what most people think of when they think of stabilizing their cameras. Tripods come in different weights and sizes, and there are even tripods specifically for smartphones. There is a wide range of pricing for tripods. Mid-range is about $50.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-equipment02.JPG"                      alt="youtube equipment"                ></p><p><strong>Free Option! Any Available Surface:</strong> Kitchen tables. Desks. Park benches. Trees. Your friend’s shoulder, if you ask nicely. Anything you can rest your camera on top of can be used to record a steady video.</p><h4 id="2-Lighting-for-YouTube-Videos"><a href="#2-Lighting-for-YouTube-Videos" class="headerlink" title="2. Lighting for YouTube Videos"></a>2. Lighting for YouTube Videos</h4><p><strong>Softbox Lights:</strong> These are the kinds of lights that were probably used to take your school photos. They create soft, diffused, light and can be fairly affordable. The LimoStudio 700W Photography Softbox Lighting Kit is $167, and that is about the average.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-equipment03.jpg"                      alt="youtube equipment"                ></p><p><strong>LED Panel Light:</strong> LED panels produce high quality light. Prices vary. The Aputure Amaran AL-528S LED Video Light costs $358 (with stand). There are also LED panel lights which can be mounted onto your camera, like the Julius Studio NEW 160 LED 160 Dimmable Ultra High Power Panel Light which costs $111.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-equipment04.jpg"                      alt="youtube equipment"                ></p><p><strong>Free Option! The Sun:</strong> Natural light is always powerful enough to make your videos look great. Consider recording outside, or near a window in your house.</p><h4 id="3-Audio-Equipment-for-YouTube"><a href="#3-Audio-Equipment-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="3. Audio Equipment for YouTube"></a>3. Audio Equipment for YouTube</h4><p><strong>Snoball:</strong> A Blue Snoball USB mic is an extremely affordable option at $60, although it does not have good range. You have to stay close to your computer if you use a Snoball.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-equipment05.JPG"                      alt="youtube equipment"                ></p><p><strong>Shotgun:</strong> You can get a shotgun mic to attach to your camera at a fairly decent price.

Unless you garner deep insights of your competitors. You must be thinking how can you gauge their company insights using YouTube and track the data movement as well. There is nothing to worry about, we have got you covered. We will show you how to analyze your own channel as well as that of your competitors’ YouTube analytics. Let’s now explore about it!</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="How-to-analyze-your-own-YouTube-channel-video"><a href="#How-to-analyze-your-own-YouTube-channel-video" class="headerlink" title="How to analyze your own YouTube channel&#x2F;video?"></a>How to analyze your own YouTube channel&#x2F;video?</h2><p> It is important to have reliable YouTube analytics tools for your brand, as videos on YouTube are searchable through Google. They contribute to generate organic traffic for you using both Google and YouTube as a medium. YouTube has a default dedicated analytics mechanism to measure how the video fares in YouTube to gain the most out of it.</p><p> Here we have collated the broadly used YouTube insights to ensure that your highly equipped, SEO compatible video engages more audience and performs well. The matrix sums up the most essential parts of YouTube analytics. Let’s go through them.</p><h4 id="1-Views"><a href="#1-Views" class="headerlink" title="1.  Views"></a>1.  Views</h4><p> Though, views determine the number of people clicked on a certain video on YouTube, it’s impossible to figure out whether the video has been watched till the end or not. Moreover, they can be altered through clickbait tricks and hence YouTube doesn’t solely put much value on them.</p><p> Views along with watch time turn out to be the best bet. Watch time sums up the total amount of time spent (in terms of minutes) on your brand’ videos. With the updated dashboard it becomes easy to get the YouTube analytics and gauge the video’s performance. Using the average view duration, you can know whether your video is being watched till the end or not.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-analytics-views.jpg"                                     ></p><h4 id="2-Playback-Location"><a href="#2-Playback-Location" class="headerlink" title="2.  Playback Location"></a>2.  Playback Location</h4><p> As ‘Playback locations’ of YouTube videos can reveal where does all the traffic come from, it would help your channel figure out for which location the video has fared well. It will guide you to reach the backlinks locations&#x2F;sites. Knowing the popular locations for your YouTube video being played, you can know whether YouTube is the search engine or they have been diverted from somewhere else. Depending on the video playing locations, the views will be segregated in to embedded video, YouTube watch page, mobile devices, and YouTube channel page. Understanding location specific views would help you decide where should you focus to enhance the performance of your video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-analytics-playback-location.jpg"                                     ></p><h4 id="3-Demographics"><a href="#3-Demographics" class="headerlink" title="3.

Traffic sources"></a>4.  Traffic sources</h4><p> Understanding the source of your YouTube video’s traffic would help you track the prominent keywords that viewers use for landing at your YouTube video. You can figure out their choice and their search patterns this way.

The YouTube Analytics tool’s panel would assist you in finalizing the most beneficial traffic source for your brand.

Likes and dislikes"></a>7.  Likes and dislikes</h4><p> YouTube insights gauge the audience acceptance for your video by the number of likes and dislikes. Videos with a huge number of like implies that it is loved by people, though, the quality of video can’t exactly be defined by the number of likes or dislikes. Even the best quality video created for asking opinions about a certain situation&#x2F;issue might be good enough but still get dislikes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-analytics-likes-and-dislikes.jpg"                                     ></p><h4 id="8-Subscribers"><a href="#8-Subscribers" class="headerlink" title="8.

Once your channel starts growing, you can then start thinking about whether you want to invest in upgraded equipment. Here is a quick overview of all items that you need to start entertaining your online audience and gaining subscribers to your YouTube channel:</p><ul><li><a href="#camera">Your YouTube Camera</a></li><li><a href="#mic">Microphones and Audio</a></li><li><a href="#light">Lighting Gear for YouTube</a></li><li><a href="#tripod">Tripods and Camera Stands</a></li><li><a href="#phone">Smartphone Camera Gear</a></li></ul><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="YouTube-Cameras"><a href="#YouTube-Cameras" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Cameras"></a>YouTube Cameras</h2><p><strong>The short version:</strong> Use whatever you already have, even if it’s your phone or webcam. It’s nice to have sharp, fine-tuned, 4K footage, but viewers will forgive lower visual quality if your content is good.</p><p><strong>The long version: You</strong> will need a camera, but there are a lot of different devices you can use including DSLRs, point and shoots, webcams, and your smartphone.</p><p>Your choice of camera will have a tremendous impact on the visual quality of your content and might drive your decisions regarding other pieces of equipment. However, you shouldn’t feel obliged to work with a top-notch camera from day one, especially since cheaper options can produce great results if used the right way.</p><p>On one end of the spectrum, you have basic smartphone cameras and web cameras, which are easy to come by and simple to operate. These days, high-end phones come equipped with quite powerful cameras that are more than sufficient for the needs of the average YouTuber. Better webcams can also do the job, although high-performance webcam models can get pretty expensive too. It is probably wise to resist the urge to start broadcasting with the built-in camera in your laptop and at least get a webcam or use your phone, but your computer’s camera is still always an option. Not having a better camera should never stop you from making YouTube videos.</p><p>If you already have a DSLR camera then it’s a good idea to familiarize yourself with it. You have far more freedom to adjust the settings and achieve a professional look for your videos with a DSLR, but that does mean it’ll take some time to become an expert at using it. Ultra-high resolution is not required for YouTube, but it certainly won’t hurt to have additional sharpness and more detail in the scene. If you’re shopping for a DSLR, look for one with a flip screen that allows you to quickly check what your viewers see.</p><h2 id="YouTube-Microphone-and-Audio"><a href="#YouTube-Microphone-and-Audio" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Microphone and Audio"></a>YouTube Microphone and Audio</h2><p><strong>The short version:</strong> Audio quality is extremely important. If you can buy either a new camera or an external microphone, but not both, it might be better to go for the microphone. <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Click here for advice on upping your audio quality without an external microphone. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>The long version:</strong> Sound capturing is every bit as important for your success as your video feed. In fact, poor audio can be even more damaging to your subscriber count than grainy video, since people won’t spend their time listening to something they have to put effort into understanding.</p><p>Again, most YouTube video makers have a limited budget at their disposal, so professional microphones are mostly off the table. However, investing in a directional microphone (‘shotgun mic’) that can pick up your voice clearly and without background noise is certainly a smart move. Such microphones can be pointed towards you while you speak, and since most YouTubers sit still while doing their shows there won’t be too much need for in-session adjustments.</p><p>If you’re not ready to invest in a shotgun mic, you can also find very inexpensive (often under $20) LAV mics. These small microphones can be pinned to your shirt, which allows them to record very clear dialogue because they’re so close to your mouth.</p><h2 id="Lights-for-YouTube"><a href="#Lights-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Lights for YouTube"></a>Lights for YouTube</h2><p><strong>The short version:</strong> You need as much light as you can get. Lighting kits can be affordable on Amazon, but you can also achieve a great look using daylight&#x2F;windows and ‘daylight’ lightbulbs.</p><p><strong>The long version:</strong> If you’ve ever tried to make a video indoors, you already know that it’s necessary to have additional light. Often just filming with the normal lights in a room will cause your footage to look dark and grainy, and possibly be tinted orange. To overcome these problems you need to increase the amount of light you have available.</p><p>Sometimes, it is enough to film near windows and&#x2F;or bring more household lamps into your filming area. For any household lamps or lighting fixtures you use, make sure to put in white or ‘daylight’ lightbulbs instead of using the orange&#x2F;tungsten bulbs that you might have for everyday use (this is how you avoid tinting things orange).</p><p>If you have the budget available to get some lighting equipment, you can find softbox lights or LED panel lights available fairly inexpensively online. Softbox lights are great because they provide even, diffused, light.</p><p>Another useful piece of lighting equipment to have is a reflector. A reflector is usually a piece of white, silver, or gold fabric stretched over a frame. You can use it to bounce light from one light source back towards yourself (this is a great way to fill shadows cast by your main light). Reflectors tend to be inexpensive, but you can also use white cardboard or tinfoil in place of purchasing a reflector.</p><h2 id="Tripods-and-Camera-Stands"><a href="#Tripods-and-Camera-Stands" class="headerlink" title="Tripods and Camera Stands"></a>Tripods and Camera Stands</h2><p><strong>The short version:</strong> You need something to hold your camera. If you mostly film in your own home that can be a desk or a stack of books, but if you make a lot of videos while you’re on the go you probably need a tripod or gimbal. Heavier cameras need heavier tripods.</p><p><strong>The long version:</strong> While handheld cameras can deliver solid results for vloggers and casual streamers, viewers do expect reasonably stable footage. For many types of videos, the camera needs to be completely still and flatly positioned on a horizontal plane. Tripods and camera stands can cost very little, so it’s a good idea to look into getting some kind of stabilizer.</p><p>When you are choosing a tripod, pay attention to how much it weighs. If the camera that needs to be mounted on it is very heavy (like some DSLR models), you want to ensure that the structure itself weighs enough not to be easily tipped over. Too thin tripods can put your camera at risk, and that’s the last thing you want. Smaller cameras such as GoPros are more flexible in this regard and can be placed on a wider range of tripods.</p><p>Even if you are using a phone or a webcam to record YouTube videos, you should consider mounting the device on a stable stand. It is possible to find mini tripods ideal for smartphones for as little as $10. These tripods are small enough to carry in your pocket, so you will be prepared to start making a video no matter where your adventures take you. If you are using a web camera, you should attach it to the stand so that it won’t move accidentally after you touch the surface it is placed on.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1997675/19272" target="_top" id="1997675">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1997675" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1997675/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Smartphone-Camera-Gear"><a href="#Smartphone-Camera-Gear" class="headerlink" title="Smartphone Camera Gear"></a>Smartphone Camera Gear</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/smartphone-camera-gear.jpg"                      alt="Smartphone Camera Gear"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1934142/19272" target="_top" id="1934142">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1934142" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1934142/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>The short version:</strong> There’s a lot of gear out there designed with smartphone photos and videos in mind, including clip-on lenses, tripod mounts, phone-mounted LED lights, and inexpensive microphones that plug into the audio jack.</p><p><strong>The long version:</strong> Recording your videos with a mobile phone can be a good decision. It all depends on the phone you have and the range of add-ons and apps that you complement it with. Almost every high-end model released in the past five years can shoot videos in 1080p or higher. Some can even produce 4K footage. If you perfect your smartphone filming technique, your YouTube videos could look as if they were made with pro equipment.</p><p>On the flip side, smartphone cameras typically perform poorly in low light. It is possible to download an app that lets you play around with settings to overcome this, but a phone-mounted LED light is probably a better solution. An external microphone might also be a necessity, but there are some good (inexpensive) options that can simply be plugged in through the headphone jack.</p><p>Another common downside of smartphone cameras is that most of them use digital zoom, which is vastly inferior to optical zoom. If you intend to shoot anything that’s further away than a few feet, you need a clip-on lens that goes on top of the built-in camera. This inexpensive device will give you a lot of freedom to work in space, and allow you to make spectacular shots even without high-end YouTube equipment.</p><h2 id="Equipment-with-Easy-to-Use-Video-Editor"><a href="#Equipment-with-Easy-to-Use-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="Equipment with Easy-to-Use Video Editor"></a>Equipment with Easy-to-Use Video Editor</h2><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                > </a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135402/19272" target="_top" id="2135402">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135402" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="336" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135402/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1938716/19272" target="_top" id="1938716">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1938716" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1938716/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/024-approved-best-youtube-to-mp3-converters-free-download-onlinewinmac/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Best YouTube to MP3 Converters Free Download [Online/Win/Mac]</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/024-approved-crafting-success-pushing-your-video-into-top-charts/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Crafting Success Pushing Your Video Into Top Charts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/024-approved-customizing-youtube-viewing-policies-for-your-content/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Customizing YouTube Viewing Policies for Your Content</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/024-approved-cut-the-clutter-convert-videos-discover-the-best-alternatives-for-flv-to-yt/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Cut the Clutter, Convert Videos Discover the Best Alternatives for Flv to YT</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/024-approved-fullframe-alliance-how-to-choose-your-mcn-strategically/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved FullFrame Alliance How to Choose Your MCN Strategically</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/024-approved-mastering-fast-thumbnail-design-for-valorants-highlighted-screenshots/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Mastering Fast Thumbnail Design for Valorant's Highlighted Screenshots</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-ranking-top-online-tutorial-providers-excluding-udemy/"><u>[New] In 2024, Ranking Top Online Tutorial Providers Excluding Udemy</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/new-secrets-to-captivate-viewers-and-snag-vimeos-top-choices/"><u>[New] Secrets to Captivate Viewers and Snag Vimeo's Top Choices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-revival.techidaily.com/winx-mediatrans-iphoneipadipodpc-windows-10/"><u>『公式』WinX MediaTrans -

Some people like to make YouTube tutorials about iPhone or iPad apps, others like to share their gaming experiences, and some need to use footage taken from their devices for presentations. Even if you do not think these kinds of videos suit your vlog, screen recording is a useful tool to have on your belt.

Wired Using QuickTime on your Mac</h2><p>If you have a Mac then you already have all the software you need.</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Connect your tablet or smartphone to your computer using a USB port, and then open QuickTime on your Mac. In QuickTime select ‘File’ and ‘New Movie Recording’. A recording window will pop up.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: In the recording window there will be a red ‘record’ button. Next to that button there will be an arrow. Click the arrow and a menu of recording options will appear. In the section where it says ‘Camera’ select your iPhone or iPad.

Wirelessly Using AirPlay and Reflector(For Mac or PC!)"></a>3. Wirelessly Using AirPlay and Reflector(For Mac or PC!)</h2><p>If you either prefer to do things wirelessly or own a PC then you will need to use a slightly more round-about method. Rather than recording directly from your iPhone you will be mirroring your device’s interface onto your computer screen and then recording it there.</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: First, you will need to download a third party mirroring app. Reflector is the popular choice. You can download Reflector at <a class="link"   href="http://www.airsquirrels.com/" >Airsquirrels.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.Next, you need to have Apple’s Airplay on your device. Make sure Reflector that your computer and device are connected to the same wifi network.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Open Reflector on your PC. Initially it will tell you there is no device connected.</p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Open AirPlay on your device and make sure mirroring is turned on. Your computer’s name will show up as a receiver option. Select it.</p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: This will cause the display of your smartphone or tablet to pop up on your computer screen. Once your device is being mirrored on your computer, record your computer screen.</p><p>You can record your Mac or PC screen using Filmora Video Editor. Using Filmora you can crop out and record only your iPhone display instead of your entire computer screen. You can download the latest version of Filmora Video Editor at Filmora.wondershare.com.</p><p>If you have a Mac you can also record your computer screen in QuickTime following the same steps listed above, until it comes time to choose your camera. Then you record your desktop instead of your device. There are a few different screen recording programs you can download for PC.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135397/19272" target="_top" id="2135397">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135397" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="180" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135397/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>After reading the three ways to record YouTube on iPhone&#x2F;iPad, I am sure you want to give it a try.

The tutorial below shows you <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >how to create a split-screen video with fun <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with the split-screen presets in Filmora.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Mac Version"                > </a></p><h4 id="1-Live-Performance"><a href="#1-Live-Performance" class="headerlink" title="1. Live Performance"></a>1. Live Performance</h4><p>Raw talent that is unedited and uncut can make a huge impact on your audience. In the above video, William Singe and Alex Aiono perform a live mashup from beginning to end without stopping. This kind of all-in-one-take performance is even more impressive when it is flawless. If you’ve got what it takes to perform your music from beginning to end without stopping, try recording yourself doing a live performance.</p><h4 id="2-Cover-A-Classic-Song"><a href="#2-Cover-A-Classic-Song" class="headerlink" title="2. Cover A Classic Song"></a>2. Cover A Classic Song</h4><p>Although you might gain a lot of views in the short-run by covering a popular song that is currently in the top charts, you may find that your views will drop significantly in a few years when the song loses its relevance in pop culture. On the other hand, classic songs are timeless and performing them may even pleasantly evoke nostalgia to many listeners. In the video above, Daniela Andrade and HanByul Kang beautifully cover the 1934 jazz classic “Stars Fell on Alabama.” Do you have any favorite old classics?</p><h4 id="3-Cover-a-Popular-Song-With-Your-Own-Lyrics"><a href="#3-Cover-a-Popular-Song-With-Your-Own-Lyrics" class="headerlink" title="3. Cover a Popular Song With Your Own Lyrics"></a>3. Cover a Popular Song With Your Own Lyrics</h4><p>As mentioned above, covering a popular song that is currently in the top charts can bring in a lot of views. But since many people do just straight covers of songs, you’ll find yourself competing for views against many other musicians if you do the same. Creatively rewriting the lyrics of the song you choose to cover is one way you can set your cover apart from all the others out there. In the above video, the performer creatively sings a cover of MAGIC!’s “Rude” from the perspective of the father in the song.</p><h4 id="4-Cover-a-Popular-Song-In-a-Different-Genre"><a href="#4-Cover-a-Popular-Song-In-a-Different-Genre" class="headerlink" title="4. Cover a Popular Song In a Different Genre"></a>4. Cover a Popular Song In a Different Genre</h4><p>Another way to set your cover apart from all the other many covers out there is to change up the genre. Whether or not everyone likes the genre you choose, it’s still undoubtedly interesting to hear a familiar song in such a different way. Postmodern Jukebox transforms a lot of current songs into old genres of music. Check out their jazzy version of Meghan Trainor’s “All About That Bass.”</p><h4 id="5-Show-Your-Musical-Adaptability-Through-Many-Genres"><a href="#5-Show-Your-Musical-Adaptability-Through-Many-Genres" class="headerlink" title="5. Show Your Musical Adaptability Through Many Genres"></a>5. Show Your Musical Adaptability Through Many Genres</h4><p>Professional musicians mostly adhere to fewer genres of music so that they don’t leave their listeners confused about who they are as a musician. This, at times, can get quite predictable and boring. Switching between multiple genres can be refreshingly interesting, especially if it’s many genres in one video. Rapper Mac Lethal explores 27 styles of rap in the above video.</p><h4 id="6-Cover-a-Popular-Song-With-a-Musical-Instrument-Or-With-Several-If-You-Know-How-To-Play-More-Than-One"><a href="#6-Cover-a-Popular-Song-With-a-Musical-Instrument-Or-With-Several-If-You-Know-How-To-Play-More-Than-One" class="headerlink" title="6. Cover a Popular Song With a Musical Instrument (Or With Several If You Know How To Play More Than One)"></a>6. Cover a Popular Song With a Musical Instrument (Or With Several If You Know How To Play More Than One)</h4><p>If you cover a popular song with a musical instrument, you not only have the potential to gain many views from people searching up your song, but you also have the potential to gain many views from people searching up your instrument. In the above video, Lily Liu performs “See You Again” on her Zither&#x2F;Guzheng.</p><h4 id="7-Play-Your-Musical-Instrument-In-a-Unique-Way"><a href="#7-Play-Your-Musical-Instrument-In-a-Unique-Way" class="headerlink" title="7. Play Your Musical Instrument In a Unique Way"></a>7. Play Your Musical Instrument In a Unique Way</h4><p>In much of the same way that performing a familiar song in a different genre can be refreshingly interesting, playing a familiar musical instrument in a different way can have the same effect. The above video is a YouTube classic video featuring Greg Pattillo playing his flute while simultaneously beatboxing.</p><h4 id="8-Cover-a-Popular-Song-Using-Odd-Non-Musical-Objects"><a href="#8-Cover-a-Popular-Song-Using-Odd-Non-Musical-Objects" class="headerlink" title="8. Cover a Popular Song Using Odd (Non-Musical) Objects"></a>8. Cover a Popular Song Using Odd (Non-Musical) Objects</h4><p>Since music is a combination of notes, you can practically create music out of anything that has a pitch, which is everything that makes a sound. With the power of editing and pitch manipulation, you can create fascinating instrumental covers like Andrew Huang’s 99 Red Balloons.</p><h4 id="9-Transform-Non-Melodic-Speech-Into-Music"><a href="#9-Transform-Non-Melodic-Speech-Into-Music" class="headerlink" title="9. Transform Non-Melodic Speech Into Music"></a>9. Transform Non-Melodic Speech Into Music</h4><p>There’s a lot you can do with music creation when you have access to software pitch manipulation. One of those things you can do is transform non-melodic speech into music. In the above video, many different clips of Donald Trump have been edited together to recreate Camila Cabello’s hit song “Havana.”</p><h4 id="10-Produce-a-Remix"><a href="#10-Produce-a-Remix" class="headerlink" title="10. Produce a Remix"></a>10. Produce a Remix</h4><p>Most of the ideas we mention in this list have to do with taking something already existing and transforming it into something new. Similarly, a remix is a transformative musical piece. But rather than performing your music in a different and interesting way, remixing involves producing digital music using music production software. In the above video, C2C remixes Stevie Wonder’s “Superstition.”</p><h4 id="11-Produce-a-Mashup"><a href="#11-Produce-a-Mashup" class="headerlink" title="11. Produce a Mashup"></a>11. Produce a Mashup</h4><p>Unlike a medley where you perform one song and then move onto the next in a sequential manner, in a mashup you blend parts and fragments of songs together in a non-sequential manner, oftentimes overlapping parts that belong to different songs (vocals from one song over the instrumental of another song). In order to do this in a way that ends up not sounding like a jumbled mess, you need to make sure all the parts you’re mixing together are not only in the same tempo, but also in the same key. My mashups have been shared all over the world.</p><h4 id="12-Make-An-Acapella-Arrangement"><a href="#12-Make-An-Acapella-Arrangement" class="headerlink" title="12. Make An Acapella Arrangement"></a>12. Make An Acapella Arrangement</h4><p>Most songs on the radio have all kinds of different sounds going on that it can be difficult to just appreciate and enjoy the sound of the human voice. Acapella arrangements, on the other hand, attempt to recreate music with just the voice. Your own voice is a musical instrument that you can use in so many different ways to make all kinds of unique sounds. Mike Tompkins is someone who has made his mark on YouTube as an acapella musician.</p><h4 id="13-Impersonate-Celebrities"><a href="#13-Impersonate-Celebrities" class="headerlink" title="13. Impersonate Celebrities"></a>13. Impersonate Celebrities</h4><p>If you’re a musician who also happens to be good at doing impersonations of celebrities, recording yourself performing a song in different voices that others are familiar with can be a huge hit. In the above video, Yanina Chiesa performs a medley of songs featuring 15 different celebrity singers.</p><h4 id="14-Music-Tutorial"><a href="#14-Music-Tutorial" class="headerlink" title="14. Music Tutorial"></a>14. Music Tutorial</h4><p>YouTube is the go-to place for many people who want to learn how to do something, including music. In the above video, Anna-Maria Hefele explains how polyphonic overtone singing works.</p><h4 id="15-Make-A-Song-So-Bad-It-Just-Might-Go-Viral"><a href="#15-Make-A-Song-So-Bad-It-Just-Might-Go-Viral" class="headerlink" title="15. Make A Song So Bad, It Just Might Go Viral"></a>15. Make A Song So Bad, It Just Might Go Viral</h4><p>Making music that’s so bad that it goes viral is not as easy as you might think. When it comes to bad quality material, there’s probably more of those on YouTube than there is good quality material. Your music will have to be extra bad in order to stand out among the competition. Rebecca Black’s “Friday” is a notable example of this last YouTube video idea.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/024-approved-a-bright-idea-boost-your-videos-impact-on-youtube/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved A Bright Idea Boost Your Video's Impact on YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-choosing-between-two-titans-obs-and-bandicam/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Choosing Between Two Titans OBS and Bandicam</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/8-ultimate-fixes-for-google-play-your-vivo-y27-5g-isnt-compatible-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>8 Ultimate Fixes for Google Play Your Vivo Y27 5G Isnt Compatible | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/can-you-rely-on-ai-powered-chatgpt-for-tailored-safe-workout-schemes-that-promote-fitness-goals-successfully/"><u>Can You Rely on AI-Powered ChatGPT for Tailored, Safe Workout Schemes that Promote Fitness Goals Successfully?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://technical-tips.techidaily.com/guide-on-correcting-shell32dll-error-when-its-not-located-on-your-pc/"><u>Guide on Correcting 'Shell32.dll' Error when It’s Not Located on Your PC</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/in-2024-is-pgsharp-legal-when-you-are-playing-pokemon-on-nubia-z50-ultra-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Is pgsharp legal when you are playing pokemon On Nubia Z50 Ultra? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/24-top-15-trending-youtube-opening-sequences/"><u>In 2024, Top 15 Trending YouTube Opening Sequences</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/innovative-screenplays-revolutionizing-film-for-2024/"><u>Innovative Screenplays Revolutionizing Film for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/rclass-in-glamour-beauty-tutorials-for-all/"><u>Masterclass in Glamour Beauty Tutorials for All</u></a></li><li><a href="https://voice-adjusting.techidaily.com/new-mastering-iphone-voice-recording-a-comprehensive-tutorial-for-2024/"><u>New Mastering iPhone Voice Recording A Comprehensive Tutorial for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/eeping-your-online-space-youtube-channel-blocking-guide-for-2024/"><u>Safekeeping Your Online Space Youtube Channel Blocking Guide for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-net.techidaily.com/step-by-step-guide-streaming-youtube-on-your-kindle-fire-device/"><u>Step-by-Step Guide: Streaming YouTube on Your Kindle Fire Device</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/two-ways-to-sync-contacts-from-oppo-a59-5g-to-gmail-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>Two Ways to Sync Contacts from Oppo A59 5G to Gmail | Dr.fone</u></a></li></ul></div><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2043617/7443" target="_top" id="2043617">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2043617" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2043617/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->]]></content>
