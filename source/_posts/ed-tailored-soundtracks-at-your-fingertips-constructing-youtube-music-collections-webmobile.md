## Tailored Soundtracks at Your Fingertips: Constructing YouTube Music Collections (Web/Mobile)

YouTube is one of the biggest video-sharing websites where you can find unlimited videos of your favorite songs in various genres for free. However, due to the thousands of channels on YouTube, remember a soundtrack you once liked.

To tackle this issue, you must create a playlist containing only those you prefer to listen to.

So, if you are looking for information on creating a YouTube music playlist on your Windows or Mac PC, Android, or iPhone web browser, read this article and follow the steps carefully.

## How to Create a YouTube Music Playlist?

Are you one of those who want to listen to their favorite tracks while working out or carrying on their work-related tasks? If that's the case, a YouTube Playlist might come in handy as you don't have to search again and again for your songs on your device.

### How To Create a YouTube Music Playlist on the Web?

If you are using a Windows or Mac computer and want to create a YouTube music playlist on a web browser, follow the below steps:

Step1 In the first step, turn on your PC, launch a web browser from the desktop or Dock, and head to the [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) website. Next, Sign into your account with your Google email ID if you are not already logged in.

**Note:** It is only possible to create a YouTube music playlist by signing into your account.

Step2 When you have signed in, look for your favorite track on the YouTube live feed page or search for it in the search bar at the top of the screen. Once you have found the song, click on it to play it, click the three horizontal dots at the bottom right-hand side of the video, and select the **"Save"** option from the small pop-up.

Step3

* **Now**, select the **"Create a new playlist"**
* Type in the name of your playlist.
* Choose to make it **Public**, **Unlisted**, or **Private**.

The differences between the three options are:

* A **Public** playlist is a list of videos that any random person can see, access, or use it.
* An **Unlisted** playlist can be shared with others by using its link to access it.
* A **Private** playlist cannot be seen, accessed or used by anyone except you.

Finally, click the **"Create"** button, and your YouTube music playlist will be saved automatically.

Step4 Repeat the second and third steps to save all the other songs you wish to add to the same playlist. Once done, head back to the main YouTube feed page, click "Library," and scroll to the middle of the page in the right pane to access and play the music playlist at your will.
