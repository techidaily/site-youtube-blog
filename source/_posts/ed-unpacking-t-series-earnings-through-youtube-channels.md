Step2 Navigate to the top of the screen and select Effects. Choose AI Portrait from the left-hand side. After that, drag-n-drop a preferred AI Portrait effect to the Timeline. Then, adjust it to the section of your video you want it to be displayed.

![select ai portrait filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/what-is-t-series-income-on-youtube-5.jpg)

You can also change the AI Portrait effect settings. To do that, double-click on the effect from the timeline to prompt a pop-up window. Apply the AI Portrait effect from there.

Step3 You can add royalty-free music to your YouTube video by clicking Audio from the top. Then, select the preferred audio to use in the video and move it to the timeline.

![add royalty-free music to your youtube video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/what-is-t-series-income-on-youtube-7.jpg)

Step4 Another crucial thing you need to do is to add Subscribe watermark. To do this, click the >> icon next to Export from the top of the screen and select Element.

![click element filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/what-is-t-series-income-on-youtube-9.jpg)

Locate and click ‘Social Media Show Element 07’ Effects. Drag-n-drop the selected effect to the Timeline.

![add subscribe watermark filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/what-is-t-series-income-on-youtube-10.jpg)

Step5 Change the position where the Subscribe watermark should appear in your video. Then, play the video to preview it.

Step6 After you’re done with the editing, click the Export button from the top bar and choose Burn DVD from the drop-down list that shows up.

![preview edited video filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/what-is-t-series-income-on-youtube-11.jpg)

**Spet 7:** A pop-up window will appear on your PC screen. Select where you want to save the edited video file from the Folder Path section. Then, enter the file name in Lable. Click Export to finish.
