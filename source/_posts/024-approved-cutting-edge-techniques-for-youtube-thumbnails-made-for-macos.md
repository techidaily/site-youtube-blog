## What is a Youtube Thumbnail?

A youtube thumbnail is a smaller version of the video, a snapshot that you choose as a preview of your video. A Thumbnail is extremely important because it is essentially the outer packaging of your video; its front cover.

Much like the cover of a book, a thumbnail has to be attractive so that it can tempt your potential viewers to stop and watch your video while they are scrolling on youtube.

thumbnails are a significant factor in determining the number of views a Youtuber gets on his videos.

If you don’t create a thumbnail then youtube will generate one by itself which may not be so enticing for viewers. The purpose of the thumbnail is to make your videos stand out among the rest so you need to pay attention to it!
