The truth is that YouTube gives room for you still to make a **business account** with a business name thus, eliminating the need to use a business name in creating your Google account.

**2\. Creating a business name**

Once you create a Google account, the next step is to make your business a YouTube account. This you do by either signing into your YouTube app or via the YouTube website in your mobile browser. Once logged in to the app interface, you will see the profile photo you used in creating your Google account or the initial letter of the first name you used on the top right-hand side of your mobile. Tap on it, and a drop-down menu will come up, tap on the 'create a channel' icon, which will lead you to another interface where you have the option to select 'Get started' or 'No thanks.' A tap on the get started will reveal an option to either create your channel using the name and image of your Google account or use a customized name.

Selecting the custom name gives you the autonomy to use the brand or business name of your choice, after which you tap on the create option.

**3\. Customize your business page**

At this point, you can design the layout by utilizing the appealing icon and banner of your choice, just as provided by the likes of Facebook or Twitter. The customized templates in Canva are there for you to design your page to your state.

I know you would be wondering how to go about this; YouTube can directly upload your artwork with a preview option available. You can crop your artwork to fit your page, making it look more professional.

To be emphatic, creating a business account is still simple but with professionalism. Remember you are selling yourself and your brand, and it is expedient to give your best on your page. Do well to describe your page as excellent as you can, let your activity in terms of photo and video uploads be of the best. This way, subscribers will not hesitate to hit the like and subscribe button. Good luck as you kick-start your business page.
