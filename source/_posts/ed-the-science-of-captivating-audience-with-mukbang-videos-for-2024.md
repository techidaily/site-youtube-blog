## What is Mukbang?

Mukbang is a widely popular trend and video genre on YouTube that stepped into Koreans' minds around 2010\. The viewers love to watch the host eating plenty of dishes while interacting with the audience. Mukbang is also famous as meokbang or an eating show. It came into existence by blending two South Korean words, "meokneun" (eating) and "bangsong" (broadcast). Nowadays, Mukbang ASMR has widespread acceptance all over the world. ASMR refers to Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response, the tingling sensation that one feels at the scalp and to the back of the neck.
