To capture the video correctly, you need to record the video with proper lighting setup. The best thing would be to record under sunlight. Otherwise, you can purchase a ring light. Make a trial video and check if it works or is there a need for a change in position.

#### 3\. Record in your favorite look

To create an appealing Mukbang video at home, vloggers work a lot on their looks. It is better to choose your favorite look. It attracts the audience and helps in interacting with them as well.

#### 4\. Select a challenge

Your Mukbang video can be interactive and exciting only when you add various challenges to it. Come up with an innovative idea, a unique set of challenges. You can try 100 plates noodle challenge or something else.

#### 5\. Add the right dish to your menu

Apart from everything, add the dishes that are easy to cook and gobble. However, record it so that the audience will crave for it by watching the video. Therefore, the menu is a significant part of your Mukbang video.
