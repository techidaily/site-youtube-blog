#### Place Keywords in Your Video Tags, Description, and Titles

#### Share Your Videos on Social Media

#### Optimize Your Channel

After setting up an account on YouTube, you must optimize the rest of your profile; this includes adding a custom avatar picture, bio description, relevant links to other social media sites like Instagram or Twitter, and links to relevant external sites.
