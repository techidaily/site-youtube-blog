![save and export](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/sourav-joshi-income-on-youtube-2022-20.jpg)

Once you’re satisfied with the end result, it’s time to save and export the video for actual usage.

## Wrap Up

Becoming a content creator and earning in dollars seems like a dream job. But not everyone understands that it needs a lot of effort and patience to reach this level of success on YouTube.

Although the journey is unpredictable, it doesn’t hurt to try. See Sourav Joshi for an example. His art or creativity paved a way for him and made him a successful YouTuber in such a young age.

You can try creating a video for YouTube. And use Filmora to make your videos impressive and aesthetically pleasing.
