* **Super Chat**: You can also earn money from YouTube through Super Chat and Super Stickers. They allow viewers to pay for their messages to be highlighted in the live chat. They can also pay for the animated images that appear on the screen.
* **Brand Deals**: YouTubers partner with brands to promote products or services. Brand deals can also include sponsorships and product placement.

The YouTube policy for monetization through ad revenue will remain the same. Channels are still required to have at least 1,000 subscribers with more than 4,000 public watch hours for long videos in the past 365 days or 10M public views for Shorts videos in the past 90 days.

![updated old standards](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/latest-youtube-monetization-policy-and-requirements-3.JPG)

That said, the 2023 new YouTube monetization requirements are a great addition to creators’ journey. Creators who have applied for early access to fun funding are not required to reapply after qualifying for full monetization.

### **Additional Policies and Guidelines**

Apart from the new monetization rules for YouTube 2023, other policies and guidelines remain the same. Youtubers are required to adhere to the following YouTube channel monetization policies:

* **Content Guidelines:** Content must not violate YouTube’s Community Guideline. YouTubers are prohibited from uploading violent or harmful content.
* **Copyright Guidelines:** Content must not infringe on the copyright of others, including music or videos without permission.
* **Monetization Policies:** Content must not be designed to manipulate viewers into clicking on ads or performing other actions intended to generate revenue for the creator.

## **Part 3\. How YouTube's New Monetization Policy Will Impact Creators**

The new monetization rules for YouTube 2023 create a unique opportunity for creators to make money. The requirements to get monetized on YouTube are now relaxed. This implies that more creators can monetize their channels. By attaining YouTube monetization eligibility quickly, small YouTubers will now be motivated to create content with more value.

### **Who Benefits the Most from YouTube Monetization Rules 2023**

Ad revenue is the most sustainable form of monetization. Creators don’t have to ask the community to support them financially. They only create good quality content and build a large following. The new YouTube policies for monetization will mostly benefit creators who create Shorts or stream on YouTube.

![shorts revenue sample](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/latest-youtube-monetization-policy-and-requirements-4.JPG)

Streamers usually have a higher watch time than the number of subscribers they have. So, the new policy will allow YouTubers will a low following to earn from streaming their content. Short creators will benefit from the high number of views shorts tend to generate.

### **New Policies Make YouTube More Competitive**

The new YouTube channel monetization rules will not only benefit creators. By making it easier for creators to earn on the platform, YouTube is becoming more competitive amongst other platforms. These policies will make YouTube dominate the traditional long-form videos, as well as the emerging shirt-form content. More creators find the new policies more friendly and are more willing to put their content on the platform.

### **Advertisers to Benefit**

The new YouTube channel monetization rules will be great for advertisers. They will no longer have to worry about their ads showing up on videos that are inappropriate or fly-by-night. The quality of channels where the ads show will be much better. This means that advertiser will have their ads placed on channels of nano- and micro-influencers. These are more likely to have a loyal following and are more likely to act on the adverts.

### **Creators Ability to Monetize their Channels**

The new policies make it easier for more creators to monetize their channels. Since this is the goal of every creator, it will be an opportunity for more people to start committing to their YouTube career. With the new ways of making money being introduced, more YouTubers will be able to generate revenues from their channels.

It’s interesting that watch hours from shorts will not count along the standard 4,000 public watch hours. This is a plus for many creators. You will find that many creators who post shorts on their channels have more views than their long views. With the new policies, it means that they can monetize their channels based only on the short’s figures.
