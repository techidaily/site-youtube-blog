## Attract More Viewers: Crafting Impressive Youtube Description with Custom Templates

Titles and thumbnails sometimes aren't enough. Viewers need to know more about the video before they watch it. What do they do to get that information? They look at the video description. So don't ignore that. But what if you are not confident with your writing skills? What should you do? It's actually an easy problem to solve. You can use **YouTube description templates!**

Description templates will let you write descriptions very easily. All you have to do is replace the words to fit your video, and you are done! Learn more about them below.

## Overview of YouTube Description

What are YouTube descriptions? There are two types: video description and channel description.

### YouTube Video Description

![example of a video description](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-description-templates-video-description-sample.JPG)

The video description is the text below each video. Adding descriptions to your videos is not required. However, if you want success on YouTube, we highly recommend paying attention to video descriptions. It will give viewers more context about the video and will convince them to watch it.

### YouTube Channel Description

![example of a channel description](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-description-templates-description-sample.JPG)

This is the text on your About page. It explains to your visitors what your channel is all about. What can they expect from you? You should put this information in your channel description. It's how you can get discovered by people looking for content exactly like what you offer. Basically, your channel description is like an ad. It tells other users why they should subscribe to your channel.

## Tips for Creating an Amazing YouTube Description

YouTube is not only telling people that they should watch your content. It also tells YouTube to recommend the video to users searching for something to watch. YouTube crawls the description to rank your videos in search results. That said, you must do it right. Here are some tips you should keep in mind.

1. Include the most important keywords in your video description.
2. Inform viewers what to expect from the video. What is it about? Is it a travel blog, food review, or what?
3. Add relevant hashtags to your video description.
4. Add links (relevant resources, your socials, timestamps, links to your other videos, etc.)
5. Ensure the hook is attention-grabbing. Otherwise, people would ignore it and your video altogether.
6. Add a call-to-action to remind your viewers to like and subscribe.
7. Note that only the first 200 characters will appear on the screen. Users need to click the "Show More" button to view the rest. So put what's most important in the first 200 characters.

### Benefits of Using a YouTube Description Templates

If you have a business or something on the internet that needs promotion, you think of SEO (Search Engine Optimization.) It makes the material appear more often and higher on searches.

When thinking about SEO, people think of Google. And rightly so. It is the largest search engine in the world. But SEO is also important on YouTube - the world's second-largest search engine. The thing is that SEO for videos on YouTube is different from SEO for Google or other engines.

YouTube descriptions play a huge part in SEO. And description templates make writing appealing descriptions easier for content creators like you.
