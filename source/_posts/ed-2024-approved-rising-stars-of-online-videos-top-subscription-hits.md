 YouTube is changing the world as we know it because now the only thing you need to start sharing things you care about with a huge audience is a YouTube channel. One-third of all internet usage is on YouTube, which means that your videos can get more viewers than the content broadcasted on some television networks.

Aside from the official channels of pop stars such as Justin Bieber or Katy Perry, the most subscribed channels on YouTube feature comedy and gaming videos (want to be a YouTube gamer?). There is an audience for every type of video on YouTube and there are channels on everything from cooking to music doing extremely well, but comedy and gaming are the larges genres.

In this article, we will take you through the 5 most popular creator channels on YouTube today, and show you what they have in common.

###  4\.  Smosh

![Smosh](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/smosh.jpg)

Originally, Smosh was a channel run by sketch comedy duo Ian Andrew Hecox and Anthony Padilla. They started the Smosh YouTube channel in 2005 and since then they have grown their team to include more creators, and their content to include animation and gaming. Smosh has become much more than two funny guys on YouTube – it is a wildly successful content company.

Most channels that have one viral video do not go on to have sustained success on YouTube, but Smosh is an exception to this rule. Their ‘Pokemon Theme Music Video’, released in 2005, became the most viewed video of all time (as of that year). This video kick-started the growth of their channel.

In 2017, Anthony Padilla chose to leave Smosh to focus on his own solo YouTube channel.

### 5\.  Fernanfloo

![Fernanfloo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/fernan-floo.jpg)

Yet another enormously popular YouTuber that comes from a Spanish speaking country whose channel attracted millions of subscribers. A 24-year-old Salvadoran named Luis Fernando Flores Alvarado is the man behind one of the most subscribed YouTube channels of all time. The Fernanfloo channel was created in 2011, and in February 2014 it had only 100,000 subscribers. By August 2014, Alvarado's channel reached 1 million subscribers, making him one of YouTube's biggest success stories. The videos featured on Feranfloo channel mostly cover gaming topics, but with a touch of comedy which makes Alvarado's videos unique.

At the end of 2015, Alvarado launched the Fenanfloo mobile app that had 2.3 million downloads in the first week. His videos are mostly in Spanish which somewhat limits his audience, but it is safe to say the Fernanfloo channel is among the most popular channels in the Latin American countries since most of his audience comes from Bolivia, Peru, and Ecuador.
