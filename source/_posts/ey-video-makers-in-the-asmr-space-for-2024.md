 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Achieving a state of peace and tranquility isn’t always easy, in fact, a growing number of studies indicate that most people find it difficult to relax after a long day. The ensuing stress can cause insomnia, anxiety, depression, and a broad range of other psychological problems.

ASMR videos are a booming trend on YouTube as channels that post this type of content are attracting millions of followers. These videos contain audio and visual stimuli that can trigger the autonomous sensory meridian response that is characterized by the tingling which spreads from the top of the head downward.

So, in this article, we are going to take you through some of the best ASMR YouTube channels and help you discover the one that relaxes you the most.

## Part 1: The Best ASMR Sleep Channels

The staggering amount of ASMR content on YouTube makes finding the channels that offer videos that help the viewer fall asleep a difficult task. We’ve combed through YouTube in search of the best ASMR Sleep channels, so let's take a closer look at our selection.

### 1\. ASMR Darling

The ASMR Darling channel was started in 2014 and since then it gained a massive following. Today, it has more than 2.5 million subscribers which makes it one of the most successful ASMR channels on YouTube.

The videos are focused around visual and audio ASMR triggers as their host usually uses whispering, role play, tapping, scratching, and microphone brushing. In addition, some videos also contain compliments, affirmations, and face touching that can potentially serve as tactile ASMR triggers. Each video on the ASMR Darling channel is created with the aim to relax the viewer and help them unwind before falling asleep.

### 2\. Pelagea ASMR

With nearly one million subscribers Pelagea ASMR is easily one of the most popular ASMR sleep channels on YouTube. The duration of an average video on this channel exceeds twenty minutes which helps the viewer fall asleep while the video they are watching is still playing in the background.

The content on this channel is usually focused on audio triggers as the video that contains kissing noises has more than 19 million views. In addition, the host of these videos often taps her long fingernails over different types of objects. One thing is certain, the content you’ll find on this channel will alleviate the migraines you’re experiencing and improve the quality of your sleep.

### 3\. Stacy Aster

Although Stacy Aster’s channel may not be as popular as ASMR Darling or Pelagea ASMR the content she produces is undoubtedly relaxing. Stacy utilizes more than five hundred ASMR triggers in her videos, which means that you will surely find the sounds that trigger your autonomous sensory meridian response.

Even though she started her channel just three years ago, Stacy already has more than half a million followers and an impressive collection of videos that contains hundreds of hours of relaxing content. She doesn’t focus exclusively on ASMR sleep videos as she also creates slime ASMR and other types of ASMR content.

### 4\. ASMR Zeitgeist

On this channel, you can find underwater ASMR sounds, videos that contain pink-colored triggers and so much more. The best part is that each video on this channel contains a variety of common and not so common ASMR triggers, which enables you to discover new sounds that may help you relax without even having to change a video.

### 5\. ASMR PPOMO

Moreover, ASMR PPOMO channel hosts role play videos that take place in the magic shop, Halloween, and numerous other settings.

## Part 2: The Best ASMR Eating Channels

YouTube is flooded with videos that are related to food in one way or the other, which is why it is hardly surprising that some of the most popular ASMR channels contain footage of hosts eating different types of food.

In most videos, the host is simply enjoying himself while eating Domino’s pizza, quarter pounder with cheese, or different types of cakes. There are nearly 400 videos on this channel and hopefully, you will be able to find at least one that contains the ASMR trigger you are sensitive to.

### 5\. ASMR Phan

## Part 3: The Best YouTube Slime AMSR Channels

ASMR videos have become one of the most popular video categories on YouTube in less than a decade, as the channels that post ASMR content attract millions of viewers every day. Finding different types of ASMR videos on YouTube is easy, but their quality often varies.

That’s why it is important to discover channels that produce relaxing and entertaining content that meets the highest industry standards. In addition, the number of ASMR triggers you can find on a YouTube channel determines whether or not you’re going to experience tingles while you’re watching some of the videos it offers.
