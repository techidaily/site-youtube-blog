There are some unfortunate times when two of your favorite games or streams from your favorite content creators have the same timing, or you want to watch multiple videos on a single screen at the same time for comparison or any other reason.

It is a hassle to continuously switch between tabs or to drag and minimize windows continuously just to watch a few glimpses of each stream. Thanks to technological advances, there are now third-party services that allow you to watch multiple YouTube videos at one time on a single screen.

Below are some of the services and websites that save you from this hassle.

#### In this article

Part 1: [YouTube Multistream](#step1)

Part 2: [ViewSync](#step2)

Part 3: [WonderShare Filmora](#step3)

## Part 1: YouTube Multistream

YouTube Multistream is a free service that quite effectively simplifies things for you and allows you to watch live streams or play up to 4 videos at the same time. Below are the steps you need to follow in order to play videos simultaneously.

The only caveats are that you cannot sync audio and it does not allow you to play more than 4 videos at the same time.

## Step 1: Open YouTube Multistream

Open the website using the link:

[YouTube Multistream](https://www.youtube-multistream.fr/)

You will see 4 boxes where you can input the links of your desired videos you wish to watch.

![Open YouTube Multistream](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/watch-multiple-youtube-videos-1.gif)

## Step 2: Input Links

After opening the website, copy and paste the links of your desired videos that you wish to watch at the same time.

![Input links of your desired videos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/watch-multiple-youtube-videos-2.gif)

## Step 3: Play What You Like

After copying and pasting the links of the YouTube videos, click on ‘Confirm’. It will redirect you to another page with all 4 videos on one screen and then you can decide which one to play or if you want to stream all 4 at the same time, that is also possible.

![Play What You Like](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/watch-multiple-youtube-videos-3.gif)

It is up to you if you want to stream 2, 3, or 4 videos at the same time and you can play or pause them at any time. It is also helpful if you want to overlap audio of different instruments just for fun or you can stream your favorite games along with any e-sport competition and add in some music to make the environment lively.

## Part 2: ViewSync

ViewSync is a free multiplayer for YouTube videos. It was designed to watch Mindcrack UHC videos but it can also be used to watch multiple YouTube videos at the same time. You can add links and watch as many YouTube videos at the same time as you wish.

Another amazing feature of ViewSync is that you can sync audio if the videos share the same voice audio or you can even create pleasing mashups by syncing different audio cues from each video. Below are the steps you need to follow to watch multiple YouTube videos at the same time.

## Step 1: Open ViewSync

Open ViewSync using the link:

[Open ViewSync](https://viewsync.net/)

![Open ViewSync](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/watch-multiple-youtube-videos-4.gif)

## Step 2: Input Links

Click the + icon and paste the link to the YouTube video you want to watch. Repeat the process and add as many links to YouTube videos as you desire to watch.

![Click the + icon and paste the link](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/watch-multiple-youtube-videos-5.gif)

## Step 3: Adjust Audio Cues

After adding the links, if the videos share the same audio voice, you can adjust the audio cues as in where each video will start from so the audio is in sync. You can play and check the audio or just manually put the exact time in the dialogue box under the video.

![Adjust Audio Cues](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/watch-multiple-youtube-videos-6.gif)

## Step 4: Test Audio

After adjusting the audio cues, click Test Audio and it will play the audio for you so you can make sure it is perfectly in sync.

## Step 5: Generate Link

Click on the ViewSync! button and it will generate a final ViewSync link for you where you can watch the finalized and synced videos. Copy and paste the link in your browser.

## Step 6: Buffer the videos

Once you have opened the link generated by ViewSync, click on each video once to start the buffering process.

![Click on each video to Buffer the videos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/watch-multiple-youtube-videos-7.gif)

After buffering is complete, the master controller will start to show from which you can play and pause all the videos at the same time or even resync them.

![Resync the videos after buffering](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/watch-multiple-youtube-videos-8.gif)

## Step 7: All Set

Now you are all set to play all your desired YouTube videos at the same time. You can also tweak the audio and video quality settings and can choose which video should play audio and all other settings will be available once you click the gear icon on the master controller.

![All set to play videos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/watch-multiple-youtube-videos-9.gif)

## Part 3: WonderShare Filmora

WonderShare Filmora is a great tool for editing your videos and content that you can eventually upload on YouTube or other platforms and share with the world. If you are a content creator or gamer yourself and frequently collaborate with other creators, you can use WonderShare Filmora to eliminate the need for a separate multiplayer.

WonderShare Filmora is very powerful and simple to use. You can easily add multiple video frames and combine them into one e.g. join videos from your fellow creators and then sync the audio in-app using the easy-to-use tools and features in this user-friendly application.

This will eliminate the need for a Multi Stream service.

## Conclusion

Now you don’t have to worry about missing one of your favorite games or streams from your favorite content creators or gamers just because the timing overlaps. You can now watch multiple YouTube videos at the same time with great ease and it will not only save your time but immensely relieve the pressure of missing a live game or stream.

You can now sync audio and create a realistic moment as if you are sitting among the streamers and watching them play in real-time that too on a single screen!
