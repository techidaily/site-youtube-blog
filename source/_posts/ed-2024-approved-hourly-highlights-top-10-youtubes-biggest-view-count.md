Other viewers will most likely comment on your videos when they are sure you will respond.

#### \- Use Other Social Channels to Get More Views

Let the followers on your other social channels know every time you upload new video on your YouTube channel. You use a short teaser video to do this. People will see the teaser video and click the link you have provided to watch the video. You can also embed the videos in relevant blogs and web pages on your site.
